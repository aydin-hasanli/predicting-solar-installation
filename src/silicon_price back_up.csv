                                EnergyTrend: Silicon Wafer Shortage Leads to Continuous Price Hike in 2Q                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20100520-229.html,"


	Due to the increasing demand and the solar subsidy reduction in the German market, all silicon wafer makers have reached full production capacity at present.

	The research institute EnergyTrend says, in the future, as silicon wafer shortage continues and German government tends to cut the subsidy in the beginning of 2010Q3 , Q2 quotation will keep on rising, estimated up by 8.5% on quarterly base.


	According to the survey of EnergyTrend, the silicon wafer market quotes maintain uptrend, ranging from $3 to $3.2 per piece. The average price is $3.2, dropping slightly compared with 2009Q4.  
	Both the silicon wafer shortage and Q3 2010 subsidy cuts in Germany strengthen the restocking momentum in the third quarter of 2010, further boosting the silicon wafer price in the market.

	EnergyTrend estimates the quarterly growth rate of quotes up 8.5% in Q2. However, as the market demand will enter the low season in Q3, the average price for this quarter will remain nearly the same as that of Q2, even likely to have a tentative price fall and the quarterly growth rate is estimated between 0% and 1.5%.    
	 
	In regard to the price trend of polycrystalline silicon, because first-tier and emerging makers will ramp up production capacities in the 2H 2010, the oversupply will become more severe, prompting manufacturers to take a more aggressive quotation strategy.

	EnergyTrend believes polycrystalline silicon makers will face more price pressure than silicon wafer and solar cell makers. The polycrystalline silicon price will drop to $50/kg, quarterly price down by 10%. If the demand outlook doesn’t meet the expectation, the polycrystalline silicon makers may set a strategic price between $48 and $49 per kilogram in the early Q3 for major customers in order to ensure the shipment as expected.

	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, German government’s decision to cut solar subsidies from July 1st has instead prompted more advance orders; hence battery and module makers have reached full production capacity, leading to a continuous supply shortage. EnergyTrend also finds out in the survey that current cell market quotes still maintain uptrend.



	The price of the polycrystalline silicon solar energy cell ranges from $1.35/Wp to $1.55/Wp while the monocrystalline silicon solar energy cell prices are between €1.4/Wp and €1.6/Wp. And the average cell price is at $1.4/Wp. In terms of the price trend, the average price maintains $1.3/Wp in Q1 but drops about 5% from Q409. In the Q2 outlook, the price will continue to rise in April and May with an increase of 3%~5% each month but expected to grow by 3% in June. The Q2 average price is predicted to be $1.41/Wp, up 8.7% from Q1.


	On the other hand, due to the influence of the debt crisis in Eurozone, the foreign currency exchange risk heightens with widening fluctuations in recent exchange rates, so relevant makers currently make quotes based on the US dollar. Besides, although the Southern Europe has generated greatest solar energy demand apart from Germany, the credit problem across this region has aroused concerns about the whole market demand for the latter half of the year. Plus, the German reduction of solar subsidies from July 1st will affect the consumer’s purchase will of solar energy systems.

	In conclusion, EnergyTrend believes that the July demand will be slightly affected, resulting in a slim decline in cell prices.

                                EnergyTrend: Global Solar Energy Market Demand to Keep Growth in 3Q                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20100715-374.html,"


	 


According to EnergyTrend, a research division of Trendforce Corp., the solar energy industry remains the buyer’s market in the short term, so the market demand will directly influence the industry growth. As the European market with feed-in tariff policies still takes up over 50% of the global market, EnergyTrend believes that global solar energy market will keep growth in 2010 Q3. 



The amended feed-in tariff scheme has been unanimously passed by German Federal Parliament. Based on the new plan, the 16% feed-in tariff reduction for the Rooftop System, which was supposed to take effect on July 1st, will be introduced into two phases: 13% decrease in the first phase from July 1st and another 3% decline in the second phase from October 1st. In addition to the mentioned system, the new policy also covers the Ground Mounted System and the Utility Market System. In the first phase, the feed-in tariff rates will drop 12% for the Ground Mounted System and 8% for the Utility Market System followed by 3% cuts for both systems in the second phase. 

In EnergyTrend’s opinion, as the new feed-in tariff scheme is less aggressive than the original one and it is in 4Q that the feed-in tariff will be reduced by 16%, 3Q installations will be promoted. EnergyTrend further estimates that the installation in German market can be lifted from 1.5GW~2GW to 2GW~2.5GW in 3Q. In view of 4Q installations, although part of the demand will advance into Q3, rush order effect will still occur under the impact of next year’s German feed-in tariff cuts. In this case, EnergyTrend predicts 4Q installations to be 0.6GW~0.8GW and 2H10 installations to be 2.6GW~3.3GW. Besides, according to EnergyTrend’s survey, German solar energy market shows a phenomenal growth in the first half of the year with installations estimated around 3GW. Hence, EnergyTrend has raised installations in 2010 German market to 5.5GW~6.3GW. 

Regarding the rapid growth of the 2010 German market, EnergyTrend considers it as negative for the short term development of global solar energy market. For instance, in 2008, the Spanish solar energy market expanded fast into 2.5GW but froze quickly in 2009. The great fluctuation of the single market demand plus the financial tsunami resulted into almost zero growth of the solar energy market in 1H 2009. 

According to EnergyTrend’s interviews, manufacturers think that the development of German market is unlikely to run out of control like the 2008 Spanish market. However, in light of further feed-in tariff cuts in Germany, Italy, Spain and France next year, they hold a conservative attitude toward the market demand for the first half of next year.

                                Price of Solar Cells in 4Q10 is Estimated to Decrease by 8%-12% Due to Weak Demand and Climate Impact                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20101012-593.html,"

Affected by the forecasted declining market demand in the first half of 2011 and the current severe cold weather in Europe, TrendForce, the research institute, indicates that the price of solar cells in the fourth quarter of 2010 may decrease by 8%-12% to $1.21/per Watt～$1.26/per Watt.
According to TrendForce’s survey, the average price quote of solar cells in September slightly declined by $0.01. However, the average price quote still remained at $1.43/per Watt in the third quarter of 2010. Besides, the capacity utilization rate has maintained at high level. It is forecasted that the profitability level may remain high.

	As for the outlook of solar cells in the fourth quarter of 2010, since the demand from the German market has started declining, the spot price in 1HOct arrived at $1.38/per Watt - $1.4/per Watt, declining by $0.02-0.04 MoM. In terms of the price quotation of December in 2010, the bid price from solar module manufacturers dropped to around $1.3/per Watt, reducing by 6%-7% compared to the current bid price. It is showed that module manufacturers took a conservative attitude towards the demand in the first half of 2011, which met TrendForce’s early forecast on the worldwide solar market demand in 2011.

Source：TrendForce, October 2010
In terms of the demand and supply of solar cells in the latter half of 2010, the demand still remained strong. However, the dates of shipments were mostly scheduled before the end of November, which caused the declining price in the fourth quarter in 2010. On the other hand, according to the latest weather forecast, influenced by anti-ENSO events, the severely cold weather in the European areas may occur. It is estimated that the opportunity of rush orders is low in Europe in December, and that is unfavorable for prices to increase.
TrendForce indicates that the price fluctuation of solar cells only limited to the transactions between solar cell manufacturers and module manufacturers at this stage. Hence, the price of wafers still remains the same, which is not affected by the declining transaction price for the downstream clients. If the pressure from the decreasing solar cell price continues to increase, the solar cell manufacturers are forced to reduce the prices of wafers and Poly-Si to reflect costs.

	With the advent of the traditional slow season, demand momentum has slowed down and the period of product clearing has been extended. Hence, EnergyTrend believes that continued price decline in the overall solar industry will be inevitable, and solar companies will likely face challenges in achieving profitability.


	In the Module segment, the current prices fell 1~2% compared to last week, but module makers indicated that demand momentum and the rate of product clearing has shown no apparent reversal, therefore, pressure to lower prices still exists. In the Cell segment, since customers continue to request price decrease, so prices have fallen below $ 1.2/per watt this week. Furthermore, some manufacturers are facing pressure from increased inventory levels, and in the short term, the continued declined of prices will inevitable, with quotation likely to be close to $ 1.1/per watt over the next few weeks. 

	For upstream Poly and Wafer, affected by the continued price reduction of their customers, Poly and Wafer manufacturers have also been asked to absorb some of the losses, therefore, Poly and Wafer prices also declined this week. However, according to information gathered from visiting Poly ans Wafer manufacturers, EnergyTrend noted that production capacity may still be tight in 2011, therefore, although prices may continue to decline, the fluctuations should be fairly moderate.
	In the silicon film segment, although price quotes are still adjusted according to price fluctuations of silicon modules, leading to the decline in prices of silicon film. Upon further analysis, the Nc-Si Nanocrystalline Silicon and A-Si Amorphus Silicon products differ slightly – for Nc-Si Nanocrystalline Silicon, as there is no significant increase in production capacity in the short term, and since Nc-Si Nanocrystalline Silicon is more efficient than traditional A-Si Amorphus Silicon, therefore, its contract price still maintained at $ 1.5/per watt. For A-Si Amorphus Silicon products however, due to low conversion efficiency and aggressive market competition, manufacturers face greater pressure on prices.
	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, currently, spot market price for A-Si Amorphus Siliconreached $ 1.23/per Watt.
	Looking ahead, EnergyTrend noted that prices may continue to decline before the Chinese New Year, but in late February, market demand momentum is expected rebound, and potentially stabilize the price decline.

January 20, 2011 --- According to a price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce Corp., solar spot prices slightly decreased this week. The decreasing scale is within 1%, a number smaller than last week. It is also considered to be approaching the bottom price for manufacturers. Yet, EnergyTrend believes that within a few weeks the price may stabilize if there is no major market catalyst.
The average quotation of cells also dropped from $1.2/Watt to $1.19/Watt, while the module declined slightly to $1.59/Watt. The average price of poly silicon reached $69.5/Kg and wafer reached $3.59/Piece. On the other hand, thin film price remained stable and concentrator PV and solar Inverter fell slightly.
Looking forward at the future, German government is considering making further adjustments on subsidy policy in mid 2011, which might lead to a surge in demand for installation in Q1 and Q2, 2011. However, the bill is still pending and thus EnergyTrend believes that the market condition may gradually become clear in the end of February.

January 26, 2011 --- According to the latest weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, a research institute of TrendForce Corp., solar spot prices remained unchanged this week. Though some cell manufacturers offered $1.1/Watt in an attempt to probe the market sentiment, trading prices still are as high as $1.15/Watt. Based on the observation, EnergyTrend believes that it signals the price stabilization.
This week’s survey showed that the average quotation of cells is on the downtrend with a slight drop of 0.17% to $1.188/Watt, while the module declined slightly 0.31%. The average price of poly silicon wafer reached $69/Kg , a 0.31% decline from last week. Mono silicon wafer declined 0.11%. On the other hand, prices of thin film, concentrator PV and solar Inverter remained stable.
Looking forward at the future, because Chinese government is imposing limitations on mining poly silicon, it would be highly impossible to see dramatic drop in the price of poly silicon. From perspectives of supply and demand, it is estimated that the global annual installation will be 15.5GW~18GW for 2011. EnergyTrend believes that the market will hardly see demand exceeding supply in 2011 and thus the price range for poly silicon should be $75/Kg~$60/Kg.

February 01, 2011 --- According to the latest weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, a research institute of TrendForce Corp., solar cell spot prices rebounded slightly this week. Some cell manufacturers offered $1.15/Watt in an unsustainable fashion. The upward price trend may become clear later after the Chinese New Year holiday.
This week’s survey showed that the average quotation of cells rebounded slightly after touching $1.15/Watt at the current price of $1.17/Watt. The increase was only 0.08%. On the other hand, price of module remained unchanged. However, manufacturers of modules said there might be clear upside momentum after the Chinese New Year holiday. As for the prices of upstream poly silicon, the survey showed the prices dropped by 0.14%, unaffected by Chinese government’s imposition of mining cap. Though the wafer market heard bid price of $3.4/piece, the trading price was still above $3.45/piece. Yet, the price of wafer is still on a downward but smoother trend. The decrease was 0.25%. Manufacturers pointed out that the price has bottomed and buyers of wafer are losing power to negotiate the contract price.
According to EnergyTrend, production lines of major suppliers are currently booked through February and some companies are not able to accept more orders because of full utilization rate. These companies stressed that they are not affected by the change of German government’s policies toward the solar industry. It is estimated that they will not pull in production schedule until March. Moreover, because companies will start to settle contract prices after the Chinese New Year, with the increased demand, EnergyTrend estimates that the contract prices will show obvious rebounding effort.

On the other hand, average price quotation of poly silicon wafer increased by 1.18%, and mono silicon wafer rose by 2.09%. As for poly silicon, average price came back to $70/kg, a 2.47% increase.
Average prices of thin film, concentrator PV and solar Inverter showed a downward trend. According to EnergyTrend, current price of thin film reached $1.3/Watt. Notably some manufacturers offered ask prices as low as $1.2/Watt in India and Thailand where many are faced with severe price competition. In European market however, thin film price is relatively stable. As for solar inverters, the supply is sufficient and it takes about one month after placing an order to receive the shipment. The average price maintained at $0.29/Watt, dipping by 1.02%.
Moreover, Germany has announced its policy adjustments; the subsidy cut will be no more than 15%. It is expected to see companies start pulling in production schedules in 2Q. Though growth rate in 2Q is not experiencing any signs of slow down as previouly expected as a result of the policy adjustments, it remains unclear as to whether the German market will show earlier demand realization in the first half of 2011.

In addition, February contract prices showed mere increase. Because manufacturers are still cautious about the demand and economic recovery has just begun, price increase is not expected to be dramatic. The latest survey showed contract price for cells came to $1.25/Watt while that of module came to $1.67/Watt. As for upstream poly silicon, major manufacturers indicated that current material sources are contract based, adjusted seasonally if there is no dramatic price change, therefore, February contract price only increased by little to $62/kg.

As for the contract price in March, most contract prices of poly silicon are set by quarterly, and have been set up as the price of the first quarter. Therefore, the price has stayed the same this month. In terms of silicon wafer price, although it shows an increasing trend, the magnitude has substantially reduced to 0.11%~0.13%. In terms of solar cell and module, the contract price of module stayed at $1.67/Watt, while the price of solar cell has slightly increased by 0.64%, to $1.26/Watt.
Due to unsettled changes of Italian solar policy, with the guideline of the new policy having not come out, not only the Italian market demand momentum but also the price trend of solar cell and module are obviously affected. In the short run, wafer manufacturers might be probably under the pressure of price reduction demanded by clients. On the other hand, although Japan earthquake has caused a tragic disaster, the solar cell production is primarily located in the western Japan. However, because financial support for domestic reconstruction may have crowd-out effect on the solar market, EnergyTrend is concerned about an obvious decrease in Japanese market demand. Plus, the European market and the Japanese markets turned bear, EnergyTrend believes that the worldwide solar energy demand in the second quarter of 2011 might be lower than expected.

March 23, 2011 --- According to the weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, two extremes appear in the solar cell spot price this week. The price of poly silicon continued to increase, while the wafer and cell prices decreased. On the other hand, due to policy uncertainties, the European market demand is losing its momentum.
	This week’s survey showed that in the upstream sector of the solar industry, poly silicon price has increased by 8.54%, to $85.2/kg. In addition, the average price of wafer has decreased. The average price of poly silicon wafer has dropped by 4.57% and comes to $3.55/piece. In addition, the average price of mono silicon wafer has decreased by 4.29%, to $3.75/piece. In terms of solar cell, the spot price has reduced to around $1.22/Watt this week, a decrease of 0.73%. The decrease magnitude has narrowed compared with that of last week. Moreover, the average price of module has dropped by 0.43% to around $1.61/Watt. Besides, the prices of thin film and CPV have remained relatively the same.
	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, due to uncertainties in policy changes, the European system manufacturers take a conservative attitude, which resulted in apparent decrease in market demand. Currently, some vendors have cut price in the market to clear inventory at a lower price. On the other hand, although manufacturers are aggressively establishing their presence in markets outside Europe and have had a certain level of success in doing so, most success are on bidding basis. Therefore, an obvious market growth needs to be in accordance with government policies and timing.

According to the weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the spot price for solar cells still appeared to be in two extremes. The price of polysilicon has still remained at a high level, but the extent of the increase has shrunk. Moreover, the price of Si wafer has slightly decreased, and the price of solar cell has faced a price war and come to $1.2/Watt.
The survey shows that in the upstream sector of the solar industry, the price of polysilicon has increased by 0.7%, to $85.8/kg. In addition, the average price of Si wafer has constantly decreased. The average price of multi-Si wafer has dropped by 3.3% and come to $3.43/piece; the average price of mono-Si wafer has stayed the same, compared with that of last week. In terms of solar cells, due to weak demand, the spot price has reduced by 1.4%, to around $1.2/Watt this week, which signaled that manufacturers are facing pressure for price reduction. Moreover, the price of module has wildly fluctuated, mainly because some manufacturers tried to put inferior goods on sale, distorting the market price. Though the lowest price came to $1.55/Watt, the average price has stayed at $1.61/Watt.
According to EnergyTrend’s survey, due to ceased Italian market demand, the inventory level in the European market has continued to rise. Some manufacturers have already taken a conservative attitude toward the European market demand in 2011, and believed that the actual demand is lower than expected in early 2011. On the other hand, Japanese market planned to launch a subsidy for 1GW photovoltaic system to offer power supply for the Japan earthquake area. So far, the specific content and schedule have not been finalized yet, and the Japan is conventionally a more closed market. Therefore, it is forecasted that only Japanese manufacturers can get the benefit from such subsidy policy.

According to the weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the solar energy spot prices across the supply chain all went down this week, even the polysilicon price could not beat the market price pressure and decreased from the high point. On the other hand, the solar cell price continues to decrease, and EnergyTrend believes that it will greatly affect the profit margin of the solar cell manufacturers in the first quarter of the year.
The survey shows that the price of polysilicon has decreased by 3.61%, to $82.7/kg. The average price of multi-Si wafer has also continued to decrease by 0.03%, to around $3.43/piece, while the price of mono-Si wafer has remained at the same level compared with that of last week. In terms of solar cell, due to weak demand, the average spot price has fallen by 2.17%, and come to $1.174/Watt. Manufacturers indicated that there is no signal on the market as to when the decrease will come to an end. In addition, the module market price is affected by manufacturers selling at low prices, and the average price has decreased by 1.86%, to $1.58/Watt.
Moreover, due to continued solar cell price decrease, the price quotation for thin film solar cell was affected as well. The average trading price has dropped by 2.05%, below $1.3/Watt and come to $1.288/Watt. However, the CPV price has stayed at the same.

According to the weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the polysilicon price could not withstand the market price pressure and decreased from the high point. The price quotation has shown an obvious decrease this week. On the other hand, the solar cell price continues to decrease, and EnergyTrend believes that solar cell manufacturers will face a serious challenge in the second quarter of the year.
	The survey shows that the price of polysilicon has decreased by 4.47%, to $79/kg, and fallen below $80/kg for the first time. The average price of Si wafer has also continued to decrease, and the average price of multi-Si wafer has remained at $3.43/piece, which did not show a further decrease from last week. In addition, the price of mono-Si wafer has slightly decreased by 1.33%, to $3.7/Watt. In terms of solar cell, since the demand did not recover, the module market price is affected by manufacturers selling at low prices, and the average price has decreased by 2.28%, to $1.544/Watt.
	Moreover, due to low market demand, the price quotation for thin film solar cell was affected as well. The average trading price has dropped by 3.11%, and come to $1.248/Watt, while the price of solar inverter has decreased by 8.62%, to $0.265/Watt.
	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the European market demand has not shown obvious recovery up till early second quarter of the year, which results in a great pressure for solar cell and module price quotations. Some manufacturers’ profits have come to the break-even point or even losses. If the price does not recover in May, the manufacturers will face a serious challenge in 2Q11.

According to the weekly price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the contract prices of Si wafer and solar cell have shown a large decrease, while the polysilicon price still remained the same. On the other hand, due to weak market demand momentum, the module contract price has widely fluctuated, and the difference has reached $0.1/Watt.
As the survey showed, the contract price of upstream of the solar industry, polysilicon, has increased by 7.16%, compared with that of March, and come to $66.4/kg. However, there is a decrease of 5.35% in the average contract price of Si wafer, to $3.4/piece. On the other hand, the contract price of mono-Si wafer has dropped by 5.62%, to 3.525/Watt. Moreover, the contract price of solar cell has fallen by 7%, to 1.17/Watt, due to slow recovery of market demand. Finally, the module market price is affected by manufacturers selling at low prices, and the contract price has fluctuated as a result. The average has slightly dropped by 2.88%, to 1.62/Watt.
According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the European market demand has not shown obvious recovery up till early second quarter of the year, which results in a great pressure for solar cell and module price quotations. Although the contract price of April has been released, manufacturers indicated that they will still continue the negotiation with their suppliers, and hope upstream manufacturers can be more aggressive to adjust the price in correspondence with the current market situation. From EnergyTrend’s observation, manufacturers still see the spot price as a main reference in early 2Q11. However, since new entrants have limited capital and capacities, they are the price takers and they might face even more serious challenges of sales price, profit margin, and utilization rate during market downturn.  Smaller manufacturers experience price war launched by big manufacturers in the spot market and retain weak price negotiation power in the contract market as a result.

Due to the weakened demand, the pressure of price reduction still remained. According to the latest survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the price in the downstream solar cell industry has slightly decreased. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes that the sales price has come down close enough to production costs. However, the circumstances of high raw material price in the upstream of the solar cell industry limited manufacturers to cut price further. Therefore, some companies have lowered their production capacity in response to the current market. On the other hand, since the pressure of a decreasing price in polysilicon and Si-wafer has increased, it is forecasted that the price of the upstream solar cell industry will continue to decrease in the near future to get more business orders.
	As the survey showed, the price of polysilicon has increased by 2.37% to $77.13/kg. However, there is a decrease of 2.97% in the average contract price of multi-Si wafer, to $3.33/piece, while the price of mono-Si wafer has still remained the same. Moreover, the price of solar cell has fallen by 1.74%, to 1.129/Watt, since the market demand has not recovered. Compared with a few weeks ago, the price decrease has narrowed, some manufacturers indicated that since the sales price has reached close to production cost, they will consider decreasing production capacity in response to market condition. Besides, price fluctuation in the module market still remained. The lowest price decreased below $1.5/Watt, and the average price dropped by 0.39%, to 1.54/Watt. Finally, the price of PV inverter has declined by 3.02%, to $0.257/Watt.
	According to EnergyTrend’s observation, since Italian government will release their latest subsidy policy at the end of April and the peak season is approaching, the wait-and-see attitude has spread in the market. However, oversupply has still remained until the early second quarter of the year. Some solar cell manufacturers have faced the pressure that the sales price is close to production cost. Therefore, it is only reasonable for manufacturers to cut production capacity.

According to the latest survey conducted by EnergyTrend, a research department of TrendForce Corp., the decrease in the polysilicon price was limited, which was not in line with downstream PV manufacturers’ expectation. Besides, since the polysilicon spot market is still led by the sell side, the price remained at relevantly high level as a result. On the other hand, the movement of cutting prices to get orders has started. The close price of Si wafer has dropped below $3.0/piece, and the close price of cell has decreased below $1.0/Watt, which can signal that the price pressure still remained.
The price of polysilicon has decreased by 2.43% to $75.25/kg. However, since major manufacturers have cut price to get orders, the average price of Si wafer has obviously decreased. The average price of multi-Si wafer has decreased by 6.31% to $3.12/piece, and the average price of mono-Si wafer has decreased by 8.08% to $3.401/piece. Moreover, in terms of solar cell, the lowest spot price has reached $0.95/Watt, and the average price has fallen by 2.92%, to $1.096/Watt. Since major manufacturers have continued to cut price in order to compete for orders, Analysts from EnergyTrend believe that the average price will probably drop further. In addition, price fluctuation in the module market still remained. The lowest spot price has dropped to $1.4/Watt, and the average price continued to decline by 2.07%, to $1.512/Watt. Finally, the price of thin film has been influenced, and average price has gone down by 5.45%, to $1.18/Watt.
According EnergyTrend’s observation, wafer and cell manufacturers are now faced with a price war where those with economies of scale take cost advantages over other smaller manufacturers to cut prices in order to receive orders. The average cell price has gone nearly $1.0/Watt. On the other hand, manufacturers that have weakness on cost management can only follow the price reduction or reduce their utilization rate. As a result, smaller manufacturers can hardly avoid losses under such circumstances.
The Italian government will release the official subsidy policy in the end of April, and the German government will decide whether they will further decrease subsidy in June as well. These uncertain factors in subsidy policies are expected to be solved in the first half of the year, and it will help market demand recovery in the latter half of the year.

	Due to low market visibility, the average price of solar cell has been closed to $1.0/Watt. If the market demand does not recover, the cell price might probably go down below $1.0/Watt. This price trend is as the same as EnergyTrend’s estimation- the solar cell price will decrease to $1.0/Watt in the short term. On the other hand, currently, the Si-wafer price has fallen below $3/Piece, and the module price has dropped to $1.5/Watt as well. EnergyTrend believes that manufacturers will have a loss, except for polysillion and system manufacturers.

	According to latest survey, the price of polysilicon has decreased by 2.62% to 73.275/kg. Compared with other products, there is a slight decrease in the polysilicon price. Moreover, due to increasing Si-wafer price pressure, the average price has shown an obvious decrease. Therefore, the average price of multi-Si wafer has fallen by 4.78%, to $2.971/piece, and that of mono-Si wafer has dropped by 2.35%, to $3.321/piece. Furthermore, the solar cell spot price has reached $0.9/Watt at the lowest, and the average price has declined by 5.66%, to $1.034/Watt. Due to unpromising outlook in the second quarter of the year, EnergyTrend believes that manufacturers will face much serious challenges in this quarter. Besides, due to weak demand in the module market, the module price has come to $1.4/Watt at the lowest, and average price has decreased by 1.52%, to $1.489/Watt. Also, the average price of thin film has fallen by 0.93%, to $1.169/Watt.         

	According to EnergyTrend’s observation, since market status has consistently lowered and the demand has not recovered, manufacturers take a conservative attitude toward the future development and there is a sharp decrease in market prospects. Manufacturers have reduced production in response to current market status at this stage, and utilization rate only stays at around 80%. In terms of future development, manufacturers indicated that after Si-wafer manufacturers consistently lowered their price, only polysilicon manufacturers still got a profit in the solar cell supply chain. Therefore, the second quarter of the year will a critical time for polysilicon price change. If market status has not shown a recovery, the polysilicon manufacturers will face a great price pressure, and polysilicon price might show an obvious change.

	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the average price of solar cell has approached $1.0/Watt. Manufacturers indicated that since the uncertainties in Europe has been neutrialized, the price quotation of solar cell stayed at $1.0/Watt. On the other hand, since some manufacturers have slashed the wafer price in order to reduce their inventories, the wafer price has come to $2.6/piece at the lowest, but the major closing price is still at over $2.8/Piece. Besides, the module price stayed between $1.4/Watt-$1.5/Watt. However, some polysillicon manufacturers still set their price at over $70/kg, which is not line with downstream manufacturers’ expectation.

	According to latest survey, the price of polysilicon has decreased by 0.75% to 72.725/kg. EnergyTrend believes that since the uncertainties about Italian market has been settled, the price decrease has narrowed. However, manufacturers have still take a wait-and-see attitude toward the market development, and held back on the product price. Moreover, the price pressure also brings to Si-wafer manufacturers, and average price has decreased by 2.73%, to $2.89/piece. Besides, the mono-Si wafer has fallen by 0.99%, to $3.288/piece. Furthermore, the lowest spot price of solar cell still stayed at $0.9/Watt, but the average price dropped by 2.22%, to $1.011/Watt. Due to weak module market demand, the average price has broadly fallen by 2.42%, to $1.453/Watt. In terms of thin film, the average price has slightly decreased by 1.54%, to $1.151/Watt.

	Although the Italian government has announced the latest subsidy policy, EnergyTrend indicates that the subsidy policy reveals both good and bad news. The good news is that the Italian government does not set a limitation on small system installation, and increases the specification to 1MW. The bad news is that Italian government set a certain amount of subsidy on the large system. In addition, if modules, PV inverters, and system installation parts made by European manufacturers can be adopted, the corporation can receive 10% reward, which gives non-European corporations a serious challenge in the European market. On the other hand, due to high inventory level in Europe, even the uncertain factor has disappeared, EnergyTrend believes that the recovery of market demand in 2H2011 depends on the speed of inventory clearance in the European market between June and August.

Though the uncertainties about the Italian policy change have been resolved, the end market demand has not materialized. As the wait-and-see attitude in the PV market remains, an obvious price decrease appeared once again. According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the spot price of polysilicon first dropped to under $70/kg, and the price pressure has shifted to polysilicon manufacturers.
On the other hand, the average spot price of solar cells also decreased below $1.0/Watt, which showed that the market demand is still low. Manufacturers indicated that the market visibility is so low that the price is not the most important determinant at this stage, and that the material procurement will depend on the amount of sales orders.
Furthermore, the price of polysilicon has decreased by 7.25% to 67.45/kg. EnergyTrend believes that under the circumstance of high polysilicon price, polysilicon manufacturers have to share their profits with clients. However, a huge price pressure of Si-wafer still remains, so the average price of multi-Si wafer has dropped by 7.09%, to $2.685/piece, and that of mono-Si wafer has fallen by 9.43% to $2.978/piece.
	Besides, the solar cell market spot price remains at $0.9/Watt with the lowest surveyed price dipping below $0.9/watt in the market. The average solar cell price has decreased by 5.34% to $0.957/Watt. Moreover, due to a weak demand in the module market, the average price has consistently decreased by 3.23% to $1.406/Watt. Finally, the average price of thin film has fallen by 5.3% to 1.09/Watt, affected by a continued decrease in the PV module price.   
	In terms of contract price, according to EnergyTrend’s survey, the gap between contract price and spot price of polysilicon has increased to $3.0/kg. Under the circumstance of a decreasing spot price, re-negotiation and longer lead time have occurred in the contract market. Moreover, due to a decrease in the market spot price, the contract prices of wafer, cell, and module have been under pressure and follow the spot market price. The contract price of polysilcion has decreased by 3.11% to $64.375/kg; multi-Si wafer has fallen by 11.76% to $3.0/piece; solar cell has dropped by 9.74% to $1.056/Watt; and module has reduced by 7.17% to $1.502/Watt.

Based on the latest survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the market demand is yet to pick up, therefore the inventory still remained at a high level. As a result, the polysilicon price has significantly dropped. The average spot price of polysilicon has decreased by over 10%, come to below $60/kg. Moreover, the average price of solar cell has decreased to below $0.95/Watt. Manufacturers indicated that the market’s confidence is as low as the financial meltdown in 2008.
According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the polysilicon price has come to 52/kg at the lowest, and the average polysilicon price has quickly decreased by 12.71%, to $58.875. EnergyTrend indicated that the polysilicon manufacturers are barely able to survive the huge price pressure, and the closing price is approaching $50/kg. In addition, Si wafer manufacturers are also under price pressure. The average price of multi-Si wafer and mono-Si wafer has respectively fallen by 9.87% and 6.08%, to $2.42/piece and $2.8/piece.
Furthermore, the solar cell price has decreased to $0.85/Watt at the lowest, and the average price has slightly dropped by 0.84%, to $0.95/Watt. Compared with that of polysilicon and wafer, EnergyTrend believes that the slash in solar cell price has reached to the manufacturers’ maximum tolerance. Before the upstream players show obvious price response, the cell price might only reflect a slight decrease. Besides, due to low demand in the module market, the average price of module has continued to decrease by 3.27%, to $1.36/Watt. Also, the average price of thin film has decreased by 3.21%, to $1.055/Watt. Finally, the average price of PV inverter has fallen by 5.06%, to $0.244/Watt.
EnergyTrend believes that inventory turnover is still the key factor for the PV market demand recovery. Cumulative ready-for-sale inventory in Italy is around 3.5GW, and 1.5GW~2GW in other regions. On the other hand, inventory problems also exist in the polysilicon, wafer and solar cell fields. EnergyTrend estimates that it will take 1-2 months to digest the total inventory in stock as if all inventories were converted to equivalent cell capacity. Apart from high inventory level, many countries have curtailed feed-in tariff policies, which resulted in a decreasing IRR ratio. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes that since many factors affected market demand and oversupply still remained, the market demand would not recover in the short run.

	According to the latest survey by EnergyTrend, the market demand is yet to pick up, and the inventory in stock still remains at a high level. As a result, the polysilicon price has significantly dropped. EnergyTrend’s survey shows that the spot price of polysilicon has fallen to $50/kg at the lowest but such a low price is not widely accepted. Moreover, the average price of solar cell has reached below $0.9/Watt, and downstream manufacturers continued to cut price. Manufacturers indicated that the Intersolar Europe 2011 is going to be held in Munich, Germany next week, so the solar energy market takes a conservative attitude toward the current price quotation. However, EnergyTrend believes that if the outlook for 2H11 continue to remain gloomy, price decrease will continue.

	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the polysilicon price has come to 50/kg at the lowest, and the average polysilicon price has rapidly decreased by 2.34%, to $57.5. Although Intersolar Europe is going to start soon and a conservative attitude has remained in the market, it is believed that the closing price might decrease to under $50/kg in the short run. In addition, Si wafer manufacturers are also under price pressure. The average price of multi-Si wafer and mono-Si wafer has respectively fallen by 4.83% and 3.93%, to $2.303/piece and $2.687/piece. Furthermore, the solar cell price has decreased to $0.8/Watt at the lowest, and the average price has dropped by 6.43%, to $0.89/Watt. Manufacturers indicated that the price trend shows a continued decrease. EnergyTrend indicates that solar cell manufacturers have felt much pressure in the decreasing price, so the disagreements between buyers and sellers will remain for now. In addition, since market demand has not picked up, the average price of module has continued to decrease by 0.51%, to $1.35/Watt, primarily because manufacturers are aggressive to lower their inventory.



EnergyTrend believes that reducing inventory is still the key factor for the PV market demand recovery. According to EnergyTrend’s latest survey, although the speed of inventory clearance is still slow, manufacturers expect sufficient recovery will occur in the second half of the year. On the other hand, even high inventory level remained, Chinese manufacturers are still optimistic about their capacity expansion plans. Based on recent announcements made by big names, Chinese manufacturers aggressively increase their capacities, in the polysilicon, Si-wafer, solar cell, and module fields. For instance, Top-tier PV manufacturers, like GCL and Trina Solar do not fear the current market downtrend, and still follow their original plan to increase their capacities. This particular market development resembles memory industry a few years ago. However, will this similar development enable Chinese manufacturers to dominate the solar energy industry in the future? EnergyTrend believes that since the PV market largely depends on government policies, the procedure is not easy to be duplicated and the result is not easy to be achieved, either.

                                Opening of Intersolar Europe 2011 and Half-Yearly Financial Report Releases Lead the PV Market Development                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20110608-1502.html,"

According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the spot price quotation this week is quite stable, compared to last week. However, the PV market demand remains uncertain. From the subsidy policy's point of view, Germany is considering a further 6% cut in previously scheduled solar subsidy cut, and there was only a slight subsidy cut in the mid 2011. In addition, the uncertain factor of the Italian policy has resolved. With policy catalyst from Germany and Italy, the market demand is expected to recover in the second half of the year. In addition, PV manufacturers are going to report their half-yearly financial results. In order to reduce losses resulted from mark-to-market valuation, manufacturers will try more aggressively to reduce their high-cost inventory. Under the aforementioned circumstance, EnergyTrend believes that the possibility of major price distortion will appear during Intersolar Europe 2011, which may cause another uncertain factor for the PV market development.
The latest survey showed that the lowest polysilicon price has remained at 50/kg, but the average polysilicon price has rapidly decreased by 4.1%, to $55.14/kg. Since some Si-wafer and solar cell manufacturers have resold their inventory in the market to reduce their inventory. It is believed that the polysilicon price may decrease below $50/kg during Intersolar Europe 2011. In terms of Si-wafer, manufacturers still face considerable price pressure, the average price of multi-Si wafer and mono-Si wafer has respectively fallen by 1.91% and 3.16%, to $2.259/piece and $2.602/piece. Furthermore, the lowest solar cell spot price has stayed at $0.8/Watt, and the average price has dropped by 1.8%, to $0.872/Watt. Due to possible German policy changes, manufacturers might be stimulated pull in their procurement earlier which spreads conservative attitude in the market. On the other hand, the average price of module continued to decrease by 1.33%, to $1.335/Watt. The average price of PV inverter has slightly decreased by 0.82, to $0.24/Watt. Since there is no obvious recovery of demand in the market, and the inventory in stock still remains at a high level. Despite the positive effect of the German policy change, the conservative approach toward the market development still remains while manufacturers aggressively try to reduce their inventories.
	According to EnergyTrend’s latest survey, the speed of inventory clearance is still slow. However, the shipment in the German market is stable, and the policy change may have positive influence on the currently gloomy market condition. EnergyTrend believes that the current inventory in stock is as much as 7GW, and even the German market demand alone will not be able to suffice for market recovery in the second half of 2011. On the other hand, the Chinese, U.S., and Japanese markets’ total planned demand is as much as 5GW in 2011. However, it is uncertain that the planned demand can be realized, which is a key factor for the market development in 2H11. In addition, EnergyTrend noticed that there is a slight change to the western countries’ attitude toward renewable energy development; wind power might become the first choice among various renewable energy sources. For instance, Germany has announced that they will abolish nuclear energy generators by 2022, and wind power is to replace nuclear energy. It is obvious that the western countries have noticed that PV industry is rather underdeveloped in terms of readiness. Therefore, it is believed that wind power is a potential replacement for nuclear energy since the western countries own key technologies, main market development, competitive strengths, and low cost of power generation, compared with that of solar energy.

                                Solar Industry Signaled a Mixed Message in Early June; Spot Price Reached New Low but Likely to Rebound in 2H11                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20110616-1536.html,"

According to the latest survey by EnergyTrend, PV spot prices have reached new low at the Intersolar Europe 2011. Though the price of polysilicon remained at $50/kg at the exhibit, it dropped below $50/kg concurrently in China. The Si wafer price has fallen below $2.0/piece while the solar cell price has decreased to around $0.7/Watt. Moreover, the module price has gone down to below $1.2/Watt which indicated the inventory problem still existed. On the other hand, EnergyTrend also conducted a survey on PV manufacturers’ capacity utilization, and found that a number of manufacturers’ capacity utilization has risen and they take a positive attitude toward the market trend of 2H11. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes that the market demand might show a mild recovery, but top-tier manufacturers are in a better position to receive most orders while second-tier manufacturers still require more endeavor to compete with top-tier players.
According to EnergyTrend's survey, the lowest price of polysilicon has remained over $50/kg, but the average has decreased by 5.19%, to $52.28/kg. Although the price stayed at $50/kg during Intersolar Europe, but it dropped below $50/kg concurrently in China. In addition, Chinese polysilicon makers’ capacity expansion plans are still in progress. Hence, EnergyTrend believes that it is likely for the price to reach $45/kg this year. In terms of Si-wafer, price pressure continued to disturb manufacturers and the average price of multi-Si wafer remained around $2.2/piece. The price of multi-Si wafer decreased by 3.1% to $2.189/piece from last week. Since the demand for mono-Si wafer has mildly recovered, the price decreased merely by 0.08% to $2.60/Watt. In terms of solar cells, the lowest surveyed spot price has fallen to $0.72/Watt, and the average has dropped by 5.5% to $0.824/Watt. Moreover, the average price of module has consistently declined by 2.77% to $1.298/Watt. The lowest price has come to $1.25/Watt, and some manufacturers even offered $1.2/Watt to speed up their inventory clearance. As a result, it is believed that the module price will continue its downward trend in the short run.
	As for PV contract price, manufacturers now make alterations to the polysilicon contracts in response to the fast changing market. According to EnergyTrend, a number of surveyed manufacturers now provide provisory clause for buyers to choose between negotiable or non-negotiable contracts and the price difference is between $5/kg~$10/kg. Furthermore, there are short term contracts for module recently, but they are more focused on low quantity with reasonable prices. The contract prices of solar cell and Si wafer tended to follow the spot price, which caused a sharp price decrease in the upstream sector of the PV industry. The polysilicon contract price has slumped by 14.25% to $55.2/kg; the multi-Si wafer contract price has collapsed by 23.9% to $2.283/piece; the solar cell contract price fallen by 19.22 to $0.853/Watt; and module price has decreased merely by 3.13% to $1.455/Watt.
 EnergyTrend believes that the capital market condition, recovery of German and Italian markets, and growth of Chinese and American markets will determine the market trend of 2H11. Since the demand in PV industry is closely tied to the financial market, the European debt crisis and the US Fed’s QE2 policy will affect the whole economic perspective and money flow which in turn affects market demand of 2H11. On the other hand, some manufacturers’ capacity utilization has recovered. However, since the total demand has not picked up in the PV supply chain, EnergyTrend believes that the market still signals a mixed message. Although top-tier manufacturers indicated the recovery has occurred, second-tier manufacturers’ capacity utilization ratio is the key indicator to determine whether the market demand will trend upward in the later half of 2011.

According to EnergyTrend’s latest survey, the market price decline has slowed down, while demand showed some signs of recovery. In terms of polysilicon price, the lowest price has come to $47/kg, but the main closing price has stabilized. In terms of Si wafer and solar cell, although the price continued to drop, the extent has narrowed. As for module, the price only decreased slightly, compared with that of last week. In addition, the inventory problem still exists. EnergyTrend found that top-tier manufacturers have increased their production utilization and taken a positive attitude toward the market demand of 2H11. EnergyTrend believes that the market demand is poising for a recovery in 2H11, but it requires close attention to track the extent.
EnergyTrend believes that inventory clearance still takes time, and the speed of inventory clearance depends on the market recovery. In addition, the lowest price of PV inverter has come to $0.19/Watt, and the average price slightly dropped by 1.24% to $0.239/Watt.
EnergyTrend believes that global capital market condition, especially the Euro zone, will have an influence on solar industry in 2H11. Since the European market is still the largest market for solar energy and the solar market demand is closely tied to the capital market, the financial health of European countries will directly affect the outlook of solar market. On the other hand, British banks have withdrawn considerably huge funds from the short-term loan market of Euro zone. The Euro zone might encounter a credit crunch, and banks without sufficient capital might have to file bankruptcy, leading to another financial crisis. As a result, it is possible that the stagnated solar market demand caused by the 2008 financial crisis will be repeated.

                                Solar Market Demand Increased, but Price Remained Low Still                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20110630-1597.html,"

EnergyTrend recently discovered among PV manufacturers a common sentiment of “evident increased demand, while price remained low”. According to this week’s survey, the spot price remained stable, compared with that of last week. The price stopped falling to new low, signaling a market bottom. In addition, manufacturers across supply chain, including mid and small solar cell manufacturers, started to see increased orders, inferring that recovery of market demand of 3Q11 may be in sight.
Solar cell manufacturers pointed out that clients now request high conversion efficiency, which caused increasing mono-Si solar cell demand. As a result, the mono-Si cell price barely decreased. Furthermore, the average module price still stayed at $1.293/Watt, and manufacturers indicated that inventory clearance is still in the process, but the price has stabilized, which will help the price stabilization of 3Q11.
EnergyTrend believes that the European debt crisis has temporarily lessened, which can help the recovery of the European market demand. Total installation volume from March to May in Germany has set a record low, and manufacturers intentionally lowered the volume in an attempt to influence German government’s planned subsidy cut in the mid year. Therefore, it is expected that the cut might be smaller than previously planned if not totally foregone. On the other hand, Italy will announce the list of manufacturers for 1.2 GW solar project plan in mid July, which can further help the European market demand of 3Q11. Apart from the European market, the US market also will receive enormous benefit from the new subsidy plan, making the U.S. solar market demand remain strong. The Japanese government, on the other hand, plans to increase the use of renewable energy, which will help the domestic market development. In addition, China and India, two major emerging solar markets, are also expected to start materializing their market potentials. EnergyTrend believes that the recovery of major global markets altogether will reverse the price downtrend in 3Q11.

According to EnergyTrend, polysilicon spot price has recovered. Although the increase is modest, the price remained above $50/kg which Manufacturers indicate is the bottom line at the current stage. On the other hand, there is a slight change in Si wafer price. EnergyTrend indicates, due to rising demand for mono-Si wafer, the spot price has subsequently increased. Moreover, as for multi-Si wafer, manufacturers plan to increase the spot price in July, and the magnitude is estimated to be a 5% increase. Some manufacturers have offered a new price quote to their client, but customer acceptance remains low. Furthermore, $50/kg is the bottom line for polysilicon price and their clients deny the price increase. EnergyTrend believes that Si wafer manufacturers will face challenges on financial performance in July.
	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, the polysilicon price has recovered to the range of $50/kg and $52/kg.   Furthermore, the average price of module remained at $1.293/Watt. Manufacturers indicate that the inventory clearance is still in the process, and the market demand is just in the early stage of recovery. So it is hard to determine the demand momentum. Nevertheless, this recovery still can help the price increase of 2H11.       
	The recent market development has led EnergyTrend to believe that the price adjustment issue is going to remain, evidenced by current polysilicon price quotation in the market. Although some contracts are being renegotiated, the lowest contract price still remained at $50/kg. In addition, major regional markets will contribute positively to the development of the worldwide solar energy market in 2H11. EnergyTrend believes that the upstream manufacturers are taking a positive attitude toward the market development of 2H11, so the flexibility in negotiating trading price is going to be limited. The downstream demand on the other hand, manufacturers indicate that their clients have drawn much attention on price trend and product performance. Although trading price has stopped decreasing, upward trend is yet under development in the short run. As for product performance, their clients request higher conversion efficiency, and evaluate products by cost per KWh. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes that multi-Si cells and mono-Si cells that have conversion efficiency of 16.6% or above will be in a better position to see price recovery in 2H11.

                                Due to Increasing Demand in Mainland China, Polysilicon Price Continues to Rise                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20110713-1677.html,"

According to EnergyTrend’s latest survey, polysilicon spot price trend remains going upward. Currently, the main trading price is between $53/kg and $55/kg. Manufacturers indicated that the polysilicon spot price has shown a strong increase, primarily due to the rising Chinese market demand. On the other hand, electricity shortage occurred in Eastern China, and the industrial sector may be influenced in the future. Therefore, polysilion production output might be limited, which will also stimulate the Chinese market demand. In addition, due to high demand for mono-Si wafer, the average spot price has stayed at above $2.6/piece. Furthermore, the main trading price of multi-Si wafer is between $2.0/piece and $2.1/piece. Although manufacturers pointed out that they wished their clients could share the reduced profit due to current market situation, clients refuse to accept price increase at this stage. Unless a large number of contingent orders take place, the possibility of price recovery is quite low. Therefore, the price changes may just fluctuate slightly in the short run.
According EnergyTrend, the average price of polysilicon has increased by 4.81% to $53.73/kg. The average prices of multi-Si wafer and mono-Si wafer have respectively risen by 1.16% and 0.19% to $2.014/piece and $2.631/piece. On the other hand, the spot price of solar price has shown a slight change as well. Due to the increasing demand for high conversion efficiency product, the sales price has stayed at a high level. However, for products of which conversion efficiency is below 16.5%, the trading price ranges from $0.78/Watt to $0.8/Watt, and average price has risen by 0.38% to $0.784/Watt. Furthermore, the average price of module has merely declined by 0.39% to $1.288/Watt. Manufacturers indicated that the inventory clearance is still in process, the demand has not obviously picked up yet. Therefore, the price trend reversal is still simmering.
	According to current market situation, oversupply remains. Since GCL and OCI have announced that they will follow through the original expansion plans, the total combined annual capacity will increase from 4.8K to 8.8K tons, which equal to 1.7 pieces of 6” Si wafer (200μm) or equal to 6.8 GW solar cell. In addition, due to low sales price, Si wafer manufacturers will face the net loss. Under this circumstance, Si wafer manufacturers will mix low grade material to reduce production cost, so the regular polysilicon shipment is lower than what would have been required. EnergyTrend believes that the polysilicon oversupply might happen in the future, and the price will be further adjusted. Hence downstream manufacturers might benefit from decreased polysilicon price. However, as for Taiwanese polysilicon manufacturers, whose capacity scale and cost competiveness are generally inferior less than those of Chinese, Korean, and other international giants, so they might face a more serious challenge when the price adjustment of polysilicon takes place.

	According to the latest price survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the polysilicon spot price continues to increase, and current trading price has stayed between $52/kg and $54/kg. Notably, the trading price in the Chinese market is slightly higher than other markets ranging from $55/kg to $58/kg. The main spot price of mono-Si wafer stays between $2.6/piece and $2.65/piece due to its high market demand. Also, the main spot price of multi-Si wafer stays between $1.95/piece and $2.1/piece. According to EnergyTrend, PV manufacturers take a wait-and-see attitude toward the market in 3Q11. Currently, they put more focus on the order demand of 3Q11 to evaluate the market development. On the other hand, although most of PV spot prices went up, the extent has narrowed. It might signal the end market demand is less than expected, and the price trend of 3Q11 could reverse.

	According to current market trend, EnergyTrend believes the oversupply still remains. As far as the supply chain is considered, the price rebound first occurred in the upstream, namely, the polysilicon sector. Although Si wafer manufacturers sought to keep up with the price trend, the price recovery of Si wafer could not overhaul the price increase of polysilicon. Currently, major Si wafer manufacturers not only mix substitute materials to reduce cost, but also try to renegotiate terms with their suppliers. However, the efforts to gain support from suppliers appears to be futile. Hence, EnergyTrend believes that the Si wafer manufacturers’ profit in 3Q11 may be compromised. On the other hand, participants of Intersolar North America Exhibit which was completed last week indicated the system and power plant projects drew relatively more attention at the event. Compared with other markets, the North American market demand still remains strong, and it is estimated that the market demand for system installation will reach as high as 2GW this year. Therefore, system manufacturers are now aiming for the potential growth of the North American market as the next major market development.

	According to EnergyTrend’s survey, although major project bids of the U.S. focus on large scale utility plant establishments, smaller projects such as rooftop systems will also benefit from state governments and the federal government’s subsidies. EnergyTrend indicates that since European governments have cut the subsidies for large solar energy power plants substantially, the rooftop system market will be the major market driver from now on. In addition, the US market might resemble such a market trend in the future. The conversion efficiency plays an important role in developing rooftop systems, and thus it is expected that the manufacturers including Taiwanese makers with advanced technology will be in a better position to grasp new business opportunities.

	According to the latest survey conducted by EnergyTrend, manufacturers indicated that they are conservative about September orders and the PV market of 3Q11. On the other hand, the spot price of polysilicon remained at a high level. The Chinese market demand still stayed high, while other markets showed signs of slowing. According to EnergyTrend, downstream manufacturers are conservative about spot price trend of polysilicon, primarily because most orders from large manufacturers are signed on contractual terms, and few make purchase on the spot market. The second tier and third tier manufacturers are the main active participants on the polysilicon spot market, but their combined purchase volume is much less than top tier manufacturers’. Therefore, it is estimated that the current spot market situation can not support polysilicon manufacturers to raise the price.
	According to current market situation, manufacturers indicated that they put much focus on the Chinese local governments’ subsidies. To date, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Qinghai provinces have announced their local subsidies. Among those, the subsidy of Qinghai government attracted wide attention of Chinese PV manufacturers. However, EnergyTrend believes that fund availability is the key determinant factor for the subsidy program’s future success. Furthermore, subsidy releases show the Chinese local governments’ support for local PV industry developments. In particular, Jiangsu and Shandong, their PV industry developments have reached a certain scale. EnergyTrend indicates that the subsidy release can help locally based manufacturers to overcome challenge of the oversupply market.

	Notably, the Qinghai government attempts to support its PV industry growth through the new subsidy in the hope of making Qinghai province become a big PV production base and market place. Currently, the Qinghai government has achieved the fundamental goal. However, the Chinese market is now the world’s biggest PV production base. At this stage, the accumulated production capacity in the southeast China can fully already meet the projected annual domestic market demand through 2020. Additionally, the northwestern China has also released new subsidy policy that might further spur the production output. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes that the risk of Chinese PV industry forming a bubble may increase, if the oversupply situation continues or even worsens without guidelines.

	According to EnergyTrend’s latest survey, the polysilicon market spot price has shown a slight decrease. PV demand remained strong in China, while a downtrend has occurred in other areas. Downstream manufacturers not only have to deal with rush orders, but also take inventory management into consideration. In addition, the changing PV market demand has led wafer and cell manufacturers to carefully control the inventory on stock. According to EnergyTrend, major manufacturers’ days of inventory on hand range from one to three weeks, so they can minimize the impact from sudden market demand reversal.

	According to the current market condition, since a number of European countries have released their subsidies, the European market has picked up. Because of the announcement of unchanged subsidy amount and decreasing cost, the installation volume in Germany is expected rise in 2H11. EnergyTrend estimates that the incremental PV market installation volume in Germany is expected to rise to 3.5GW~4GW in 2H11 while the annual installation volume in Germany is expected to reach 5GW~6GW. Moreover, large scale solar system (>1MW) installation is capped in the latest Italian subsidy policy, but mid and small solar systems account for the majority of installation in Italy. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes that the market demand will recover after the Italian government officially announces the subsidy, and estimates that the Italian market demand in 2H11 can reach 1GW.

	From the viewpoint of current changes in the European policies, solar rooftop system is the focus of subsidy plans, while installation demand from large solar systems will gradually fade. In order to squeeze more power output out of limited space, demand for high conversion efficiency product will continue to rise, leading to an increase in the mono-Si product price. EnergyTrend indicates that the demand for solar rooftop systems will continue to increase. As a result, it is crucial for manufacturers to be able to develop high conversion efficiency products while remaining cost competitive.

Following last week’s downward trend, this week’s average price came to $52.55/kg, a 2.92% decrease.

	Since the demand prospects for the late third quarter to fourth quarter of 2011 remained unclear, manufacturers have taken a conservative attitude towards the polysilicon inventory level. Medium and small-scale manufacturers, dominating the spot market are becoming stringent in monitoring inventory control since they are unable to weather market changes as well as their top-tier counterparts. On the other hand, as polysilicon production capacities are about to increase in China and Korea, the downstream PV manufacturers believe that polysilicon price pressure will rise, in turn affecting manufacturers’ procurement intentions.

	The latest survey conducted by EnergyTrend, the green energy industry research division of TrendForce, indicates that while spot prices for polysilicon and Si wafer have remained at $50/kg and $2/piece, the polysilicon and Si wafer manufacturers have been experiencing price pressure from downstream makers. In fact, TrendForce indicates that downstream manufacturers’ spot price targets for September 2011 are under $50/kg for polysilicon wafer and lower than $2/piece for multi-Si wafer.
	In terms of solar cell and module, TrendForce indicated that even though PV market demand has recovered partially, the market supply still exceeds its demand. While the worldwide production capacity for solar cell and module remains greater than the market demand and Chinese manufacturers continue to expand their capacity, oversupply of solar cell and module persists. On the other hand, as strong demand for high conversion efficiency product persists, the price quotations for related products have remained unchanged.
	In addition, TrendForce continues to monitor the potential meltdown of the U.S. Solar Industry. After REC and Q-Cells’ announcement for closing their production lines, TrendForce anticipates a rapid profit margin decline will increase the management pressure for both American and European manufacturers.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, polysilicon price is beginning to show signs of relaxation, with some manufacturers already quoting prices lower than US$50/kg. This development is unsurprising; wafer and cell makers all experienced losses in Q2, according to the released quarter’s financial reports. As a result, pressure from downstream wafer and cell makers to lower price increases daily. Si wafer price for Q4 is estimated at US$48-45/kg, and cell manufacturers are expecting wafer price to range from US$1.9 to 1.85/piece.

	As market demand has been weaker than expected, downstream makers’ demand for spot goods has decreased significantly as well, putting immense pressure on spot price. Although the mainstream spot price of polysilicon remains at the $50/kg threshold, some manufacturers have already quoted $47/kg. Thus, EnergyTrend believes that it is highly likely that the average price of polysilicon for September will fall below $50/kg. 
As for mono-Si wafers, since mono-Si wafer capacity still does not exceed that of multi-Si and its market demand is relatively stable, first-tier manufacturers’ price quotes remain the same. However, second and third-tier manufacturers’ price quotes have decreased. With regard to multi-Si wafers, Si wafer manufacturers are already experiencing tremendous pressure from downstream clients to lower price. While first-tier manufacturers like SAS and GET have maintained $2/piece pricing, second-tier manufacturers’ prices have already slid to approximately $1.95/piece this week. EnergyTrend expects that first-tier manufacturers will be unable to hold on to $2/piece pricing; Si wafer manufacturers will face a grim challenge on their performance in 3Q11.
In terms of cells and modules, according to EnergyTrend, first-tier manufacturers’ capacity remains at satisfactory levels, but price quotes continue to fluctuate due to the less-than-expected market demand.
	Looking towards 3Q11, EnergyTrend indicates that in terms of profit, the situation appears bleak for wafer and cell manufacturers. Unless polysilicon price decreases significantly, thus allowing clients to lower production costs, the majority of wafer and cell manufacturers will be unable to avoid losses in 3Q11.

	The 26th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition (EU PVSEC) is currently in session. News from the event indicates that manufacturers hold conservative attitudes towards Q4, a sign that pressure to lower price will continue to increase.

	According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, sellers and buyers are all haggling over conversion efficiency, price, and payment term negotiations. As the European debt crisis is not yet resolved and the arrival of the solar energy industry’s weak season is imminent, the outlook for Q4 is generally unfavorable and manufacturers are facing immense pressure to lower prices.  EnergyTrend indicates that in order to slow the rate of price decline, manufacturers are acquiescing to more lenient payment terms in exchange for better prices while concurrently striving to ease the oversupply situation with capacity adjustments. However, as the main contribution to the current high supply levels comes from Chinese makers, if manufacturers cannot come to a consensus during the PVSEC,  EnergyTrend expects that 2HSep. price will see significant adjustments.

	Looking towards Q4, as external factors will not be conducive to demand recovery, price decreases are inevitable and the outlook for manufacturers’ quarterly revenue is subsequently gloomy. However,  EnergyTrend believes that this economic downturn is a chance for the global solar industry to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it provides the industry with the incentive to break free from the vicious cycle of price haggling and move towards a more productive future.

	Regrettably, the EU PVSEC has ended without any uplifting news. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, the German market’s installation volume for June to August was approximately 2GW, with a projection of around 1GW for September. Thus, Germany is expected to see another wave of downward adjustments in the middle of the year, estimated at over 10%. Subsequently, yearly subsidies will show an overall decrease of over 20% for 2012. As the European market currently relies heavily on Germany and Italy for support, EnergyTrend expects that the aforementioned developments will have a significant impact on the growth of the European market.

EnergyTrend believes that as the market is not conducive to demand recovery, future price decreases are inevitable and the Q4 profit outlook for manufacturers is unfavorable. As middle manufacturers’ profits suffer, manufacturers that were more profitable in 1H11 may be pressured to satisfy clients by adjusting price.

	Based on the current state of the solar energy market, the global demand outlook for Q4 is not optimistic. Currently, inventory levels for the European market continues to increase, and demand was not as high as expected from the China and Japan markets. Therefore, manufacturers are eager to adjust their stock levels. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, as raw material makers are continually stuffing inventory to downstream clients, manufacturers are focused on clearing their stock, to the extent that some vendors expressed that this was their number one priority. This situation will cause market price quotes to continue decreasing, and as a result, the spot market is in a state of disorder.
	As for raw materials, according to EnergyTrend, demand from downstream manufacturers has not increased, but shipments from upstream polysilicon makers have not ceased, creating immense pressure for Si-wafer and solar cell manufacturers in terms of inventory levels. In order to decrease losses, both sellers and buyers continue with price and supply negotiations. Some manufacturers are cutting their losses and ending contracts to ease inventory pressure, but the majority of makers are unloading their excess inventory on the spot market. This has caused polysilicon price to continue falling. Upstream polysilicon manufacturers, protected by long-term contracts, will continue to enjoy acceptable prices and profits in the short-term. However, when the price difference becomes too large, manufacturers will have to adjust their long-term contracts, which will in turn negatively affect polysilicon makers. 
	In terms of the PV market perspective, since the global solar market has  entered the state of  severe  price  competition and low margins,  if GCL and Foxconn's joint effort to manufacture solar cell and module materializes, it is estimated that they will  rapidly gain a considerable market share over cost advantage.  As a result , solar cell and   module manufacturers might face considerable competitive pressure. EnergyTrend indicated that it might accelerate the speed of the global solar industry restructuring, and only the manufacturers with competitives advantages--low manufacturing cost and superior technology--will be able to survive.

September 28, 2011 --- The polysilicon industry has seen several changes recently that have been the focus of the industry. Firstly, not only has GCL-Poly Energy’s announced production capacity expansion exceeded expectations, but it is rumored that the company is considering cooperation with Foxconn. Meanwhile, the future trend of polysilicon price is unknown. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, European and American manufacturers who were unwilling to give in on price are beginning to show signs of concession in terms of long-term contract price for 2012, with the lowest quotes down to US$40/kg. As for Asian and other second-tier makers, price is expected to reach US$40/kg in Q4 of this year. Although polysilicon price has been adjusted noticeably, downstream manufacturers indicate that this is a reflection of the oversupply situation and not a positive development.
	In terms of raw materials, EnergyTrend indicates that as polysilicon manufacturers are shipping aggressively, more and more makers are dumping their excess contract goods on the spot market. This has caused spot price to plummet, and some manufacturers have already quoted prices lower than US$40/kg. However, related manufacturers indicate that this selling price is not the cause of the current status of the spot market. Weak demand and polysilicon makers insisting that clients honor their contracts are the main factors that have caused low price and oversupply on the spot market. Although polysilicon manufacturers have also quoted US$40/kg contract prices, makers indicate that unless demand rises, there will continue to be few transactions.

	Looking towards the future, EnergyTrend believes that price war for the polysilicon industry has begun, and major manufacturers will be using economies of scale to push newcomers out. When price reaches US$40/kg, the polysilicon industry will enter elimination phase; the development of Chinese manufacturers will be a point of focus. Manufacturers that are unable to acquire enough capital will be eliminated, and the status of the industry may improve as a result of elimination of unsustainable enterprises. On the other hand, if current expansion strategies are executed as planned, the industry will remain in a state of severe oversupply.

	Yesterday marked the beginning of PV Taiwan (Taiwan International Photovoltaic Forum and Exhibition), a three-day long event that will include Motech, GLC, OCT, and other major PV manufacturers sharing their development plans for the future. First-tier Chinese manufacturer GCL has already revealed their current profit figures, reaffirming their status as an industry leader. Looking towards the future, EnergyTrend, a green energy research division of TrendForce, the PV industry will likely remain in a state of oversupply in 2012. Furthermore, as capacity continues to expand, downward adjustment of polysilicon price is inevitable, but major manufacturers will still have an advantage in terms of price-setting.
 EnergyTrend believes that as GCL will present formidable competition to upstream polysilicon and Si wafer manufacturers, makers already at a disadvantage in terms of capacity and funding will face an even tougher challenge. As for downstream solar cell manufacturers, first-tier makers already cooperating with GCL should benefit, but as for mid and small-sized manufacturers, whether they will be able to enjoy the same prices as first-tier makers depends on the terms that they can offer to GCL.

	Currently, market rumors abound that some vendors, under immense financial pressures, plan to either liquidate their equipment or use their inventory and equipment as collateral, in order to maintain financial viability. However, related vendors indicate that presently, there is little interest in second-hand equipment. Moreover, as vendors considering the aforementioned measures are already on the verge of bankruptcy, financers are proceeding with extreme caution and there have been few concluded deals. Furthermore, European market subsidy decreases in 2012 were originally expected to spark a wave of installations in Q411, but such orders have yet to be seen.
 EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that the capacity utilization rate of major Si wafer and solar cell manufacturers continues to decrease. Some small and mid-sized makers are even rumored to be considering temporarily ceasing production in order to decrease expenditures in the face of the harsh economy. A portion of financially struggling manufacturers are dumping their on-hand inventory and materials on the spot market in order to secure funds. However, as most vendors currently have little need for spot materials, there is not much interest in the spot market.
	Solar energy vendors are also concerned about the status of the financial chain. The solar market is heavily dependent on financial support; thus, if banks become less willing to provide loans, this will be detrimental to the short-term development of the market, which will in turn affect manufacturers’ finances. EnergyTrend has observed that some makers have already reduced or temporarily ceased production, but no one has closed due to financial difficulties as of yet. However, once there is a gap in the financial chain, manufacturers deep in the red will be hit first, and there is a real danger that some makers will go bankrupt.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, as upstream raw material price decreased rapidly and manufacturers sustained fewer inventory depreciation losses in Q3, most makers’ Q3 figures were better than those from the previous quarter. However, related manufacturers indicate that demand has not increased notably in Q4, global inventory levels remain relatively high, and the industry is entering the traditional slow season. Consequently, EnergyTrend believes that manufacturers will continue to face operational challenges until Q1 of 2012. 
	As for conversion efficiency rates, mainstream product conversion efficiency rate was 16.4-16.6% in Q3, and has already reached 16.8% in Q4. Looking ahead, manufacturers have all set their target rates above 17% for Q1 of 2012. Thus, solar cell makers are currently concentrating their efforts on improving process technology in hopes of raising average conversion efficiency rate to 17% by the end of this year.
	Additionally, this week Taiwanese manufacturers have been displaying their newest products at Solar Power International’s convention in Dallas, and it is clear that makers are focusing on lowering cost and increasing efficiency. For instance, Motech boasted their new “LEO cell”, a multi-Si solar cell with increased conversion efficiency (17.4%) from new process technology. Thus, not only will manufacturers face an oversupply situation in 2012, but increasing product conversion efficiency will be another important challenge for makers to overcome if they are to survive the economic downturn.

	According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, as inventory levels remain high and demand is not strong, PV price continues to decrease gradually. However, the lower prices have not enticed buyers and stimulated demand. Based on the current European and U.S. market outlook, it is likely to be a harsh winter for the PV industry.
	Currently, as price continues to fall and demand shows no signs of picking up, many major manufacturers are aiming to increase international sales. In addition to extending payment schedules, makers are providing financial support for downstream expansion, which will in turn result in increased shipment volumes. Thus, mid to small-scale manufacturers will face even more challenges on the market; not only must they deal with their own cost management, but they are unable to contend with financially stable major macnufacturers. As such, their short-term operational goals are to hold onto their cash and lower inventory levels in order to make it through the cold winter.
	The Solar Power International exhibition came to a conclusion last week, but the news from the event should keep the solar industry talking for a while. For instance, the anti-dumping appeal headed by Solarworld leader and bankruptcy protection rumors, all indicators of China’s position in the solar market. While China has a large market share, they are still stuck in a state of oversupply and low prices. Amongst the many market rumors and varying opinions, perhaps the only consensus is that winter is indeed coming for the solar industry.

	According to EnergyTrend, a research department of TrendForce, as both Germany and Britain have recently announced new government subsidies for 2012 (with significantly adjusted figures), the European market has seen signs of recovery. However, EnergyTrend indicates that global solar energy industry inventory levels are still around 6GW-8GW; while demand from Europe may recover somewhat, this new development will not have a significant impact on the industry as a whole. Manufacturers are still facing oversupply, and the current increase of installations will not provide any substantial benefit to mid and upstream makers.

	Solar manufacturers have all indicated that they are gearing up for winter; Motech CEO Tso Yuan-huai believes that the situation will be bleak through 1H12. EnergyTrend observes that most manufacturers are exceedingly conservative towards 2012, with pessimistic makers even predicting that things will not improve until 1H13. From the perspective of supply and demand, currently global capacity is approximately 50GW, but forecasted demand for 2012 is around 20GW. Thus, EnergyTrend believes that in order to restore the industry’s supply and demand balance, significant capacity adjustments – and perhaps even the withdrawl of major manufacturers – will be necessary.

	Regarding the spot market, inventory dumping is still prevalent, an indication of continuously weak demand. According to EnergyTrend, the majority of dumped goods on the spot market come from Europe and the U.S., with a portion from Chinese and Korean manufacturers. As spot price continues to fall and there are few concluded deals, traders indicate that buyers are not in a hurry to purchase and experimentally low prices continue to appear on the market. Related manufacturers indicate that while price has not yet hit rock-bottom, it is expected to reach a low in 1Q12.

	The industry is gearing up for a long winter, but facing such a harsh environment, manufacturers in the PV supply chain have begun to conduct strategic alliances or mergers. Makers are aiming to find a way out of the cutthroat, price-slashing market by improving profitability and supply and demand balance. GCL-Poly has been the most active in this regard – they will continue to expand capacity, capitalizing on their production scale and cost advantage to advance on the wafer market. GCL-Poly is also aggressively laying plans for the integration of downstream systems and power plant bids, in order to enter the end market and to develop both ends of the smiling curve theory. As for components like solar cells and modules, GCL-Poly is currently searching for business partners.
	As for Taiwanese manufacturers, affected by the nature of their position, they are currently cooperating with upstream clients, downstream clients, or each other in order to increase shipments, lower makers’ inventory risk, and escape the cutthroat market. For instance, with cooperation from GCL-Poly, Kenmec, backed by their experience with automatic equipment, solar cells, and modules, has successfully broken into China’s power plant bidding market.
	As for this week’s spot prices, polysilicon, Si wafer, and solar cell price are all on a downtrend. Lowest polysilicon price was US$25/kg, while ASP fell to US$30.1/kg, a decrease of 5.05%. In terms of Si wafers, lowest multi-Si wafer price fell to US$1.1/piece, whereas mono-Si wafer price fell to US$1.6/piece. This week’s multi-Si wafer price decreased significantly, with ASP declining by 4.47% to US$1.303/piece. EnergyTrend believes multi-Si wafer ASP may reach a low of US$1.2/piece in November. Mono-Si wafer ASP fell to US$1.827/piece, a decrease of 3.18%. Lowest solar cell price stayed at US$0.41/Watt, while ASP decreased by 3.41% to US$0.539/Watt. In terms of solar modules, while ASP fell by 1.21% to US$0.983/Watt, the decrease was smaller than last week’s, which EnergyTrend indicates may be attributed to demand recovery on the European market.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, with the global PV industry in a state of oversupply, price has plummeted in 2011 – most noticeably in the second half of the year. Furthermore, the negative effects have spread to the upstream polysilicon sector as well. EnergyTrend’s data reveals that polysilicon spot price showed slight increases in 1H11, and polysilicon manufacturers temporarily enjoyed the title of “most profitable” in the industry. However, with the addition of new capacity and continued weak demand, polysilicon price has dropped sharply since 3Q. Currently, average price has fallen below the US$30/kg threshold, a figure lower than most mid and small-scale makers’ manufacturing costs.
	Downstream solar cell and wafer manufacturers are eagerly reducing on-hand inventory by dumping on the spot market, causing spot price to fall to new lows. Caught between large-scale manufacturers and downstream clients, with prices that do not provide a competitive advantage, more and more mid and small-scale polysilicon makers are becoming increasingly aggressive about clearing inventory as well as temporarily cutting capacity to decrease losses. As mid and small-scale makers withdraw from the market for the time being, only large-scale manufacturers will remain, which will hopefully restore some order to the industry. EnergyTrend believes this will help gradually stabilize polysilicon price.
	On the other hand, Si wafer manufacturers’ inventory levels continue to decrease. According to EnergyTrend’s research, for the majority of manufacturers in both China and Taiwan, inventory levels have already reached an acceptable range. Currently, few manufacturers have over ten million wafers in stock, and those who do continue to clear their inventory. EnergyTrend believes that the status of the Si wafer industry is similar to that of the polysilicon industry in the following respect: mid and small-scale makers without a competitive advantage are temporarily ceasing production, and it is possible that Si wafer price will stabilize as only major manufacturers with inventory to clear remain on the market.

Moreover, China also announced its carbon emissions trading pilot scheme. Consequently, the tradition coal power industry’s generation will decrease as the popularization of the carbon emissions trading system increases, which will benefit the industries of assorted clean energies including solar energy.

In addition, the ASPs of 2.3Ah and 3.2Ah lithium polymer battery cells dipped to US$ 1.48 and US$ 1.75, respectively, showing a less drastic drop. The lithium polymer battery, one of the more popular batteries in the market, is mainly adopted in tablet PCs.
Weak Demand Caused Inventory Level to Surge
As a result of Europe’s chaotic financial order, the consumers’ purchasing intention has been low. Moreover, the exclusivity of the tablet and notebook markets and the consumers’ preference for low-price products has become more and more prominent. For this reason, the manufacturers have even revised the 4Q11 sales target for their high-price mainstream products and remain conservative about the outlook in 2012. The industry’s overly optimistic forecast on the market prospects in 3Q11 resulted in the high inventory level of batteries in 4Q11, and the sales of end-market products have been receiving increasing interest. Due to tablets’ higher popularity in the market, notebook batteries’ inventory level is higher than that of tablet batteries.
Battery Makers Cut Production Due to Slow Market

The low-price products’ high popularity compromises the shipment of high-end battery products, including the high-capacity battery, not to mention that the low-price products’ sales also fall short of expectations. The weak demand has caused the battery price in November to drop to the same level of 1Q11; the standard 2.2Ah battery price dipped to US$1.41, a relatively low price.

As a result of the persisting price downtrend, the mid-stream Taiwanese solar cell makers have been facing deficits since the beginning of 2011. With the prices showing no signs of rebound in the near term, manufacturers have shifted the focus to the end market, bidding for the Taiwanese and foreign solar system installations through sole proprietorship, joint ventures or strategic alliances. Referring to the global market’s dynamics shift, it is inevitable for the Taiwanese manufacturers to place more emphasis on the end market, which is expected to bring a new challenge, according to EnergyTrend, the green energy research divsion of TrendForce.
	First, the issue facing the Taiwanese manufacturers is fund accessibility. Due to that it requires a considerable amount of fund to enter the large solar system bidding market, if manufacturers are unable to acquire the support from the banks or investment firms, it will largely burden the companies’ finance. In the mature markets such as North American and European markets, obtaining the Power Purchase Agreement is the key to acquiring financial support. As for a certain investment project of an anonymous company, the lack of Power Purchase Agreement adds uncertainty to the management of the power plant. Hence, EnergyTrend believes that it more risky to bid for that particular project than for other traditional projects.
	Second, EnergyTrend  is certain that Taiwanese manufacturers will be facing the “Local Content Requirement” issue in the future. Considering the policies of European, Indian and United States’ markets, the adoptions of the local products dominate the direction of the policies. Such logic stems from the goal to increase domestic job opportunities; European Union’s “FIT Premium,” United States’ “Buy America” and India’s “Local Content” are all in lines with the logic and a crucial factor for the aforementioned countries to decide whether or not to subsidize the related industries. Regions with great market potential, such as China, Southeast Asia, North and South Africa, will be the next major battlefield for the Taiwanese solar companies, which will also face the aforementioned issues.
 EnergyTrend believes that “Local Content Requirement” has become a pressing issue and will in turn affect the capacity arrangement of the related manufacturers and their transnational management strategies and fund accessibility. Taiwanese companies which have  entered or are planning to enter the market should predict the problems they will be tackling and come up with solutions beforehand.

According to EnergyTrend’s survey, high-efficiency products are still in great demand in the market, which brings hope to the underperforming solar market. But according to related manufacturers, clients are mainly interested in products with conversion efficiencies above; those with efficiencies below 17% are categorized as B-grade products with prices 30-50% lower than those of superior products. EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, believes that it will bring a new challenge to the Taiwanese manufacturers.
	First, multi-Si solar cell products still account for the majority of Taiwanese solar cell makers’ product mix. Due to the fact that a good amount of products’ conversion efficiencies still range between 16.6% to 16.9%, products with conversion efficiencies higher than 17% still make up a relatively small portion of the total production, which the manufacturers’ revenues hinge upon. Moreover, the price gap between multi-Si and mono-Si solar cell products continues to narrow and the prices of 17% (and above) multi-Si and mono-Si solar cell products have become the same. As a result, multi-Si solar cell makers are striving to increase the portion of 17% products in order to gain profit.
	Second, on account of the increasing demand for high-efficiency products, more manufacturers are focusing on the future development of N-type products. However, the migration to N-type products cannot be achieved by a sole manufacturer; it requires joint efforts between wafer, cell and module makers and a thorough plan on equipment installations. Based on EnergyTrend’s research, N-type product makers are still the minority in the industry, and all of them cover assorted sectors from wafer to module. For this reason, some Taiwanese wafer, cell and module makers have been discussing the possibility of cooperating in order to achieve vertical integration from wafer to module and put the N-type production into action.

	According to statistics from EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, module products from China account for over 50% of the U.S. market. The remainder comes from Japan, Korea, and Europe, and these countries will benefit once the anti-dumping investigation is approved. However, the benefit to Taiwanese PV module makers will be minimal, as they are limited by production scale as well as brand image. Furthermore, as solar cells, mainly produced in China, Europe, and Taiwan, account for 10% of solar products imported to the U.S., once countervailing duties are imposed on Chinese products, Taiwanese PV cell makers will benefit either from transferred or direct orders.
	According to EnergyTrend, recently Chinese vendors have sought out Taiwanese vendors for cooperation; for instance, top-tier Chinese vendors have already begun preliminary negotiations regarding solar cell and module ODM / OEM. However, EnergyTrend indicates that as price offers have remained relatively low, Taiwanese vendors are not yet eager to accept orders.
	Though transferred orders may bring out more positive market expectations, Taiwanese wafer and cell makers revenue performance varied, according to the latest financial results released in November. Affected by the persisting price downtrend and stagnant demand, a number of companies underwent huge setbacks in their revenues. However, certain companies’ revenue increased due to increased OEM orders, resale of raw material and inventory digestion.
	As for the outlook in December, many manufacturers’ shipments will continue to fall, which is attributed to their strategies of deliberately accepting select clients’ orders to maintain prices. In addition, the solar market remains in a slump and the small amount of year-end rush orders are already in place. Therefore, based on the low utilization rate at present, despite the minor revenue contribution brought about by certain manufacturers’ inventory digestion and the long-term partnerships on material supply, the contribution of wafer and cell production can bring to the total revenues is limited. Moreover, in response to the conservative trend that dominated the solar market, many manufacturers have begun optimizing manufacturing process and seeking to join forces with upstream and downstream players, in the hope of spurring growth in 2012.

	Compared to October revenues, Solartech Energy’s November revenue suffered the biggest downturn, falling by 46.3%, while November revenues of Motech, Sino-American Silicon Products and Gintech dipped by 33.8%, 32.9% and 10.2%, respectively. Green Energy Technology’s November revenue increased 15.4% MoM, and Neo Solar Power’s remained similar to its October revenue.

                                Polysilicon Contract Price to Increase, Top Tier Manufacturers’ Stance Decisive                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20111222-2735.html,"

According to EnergyTrend research, the current spot market price has ceased falling and stabilized – some products have even seen a price increase. In terms of January 2012 contract price, some upstream suppliers are planning for a slight increase. However, negotiations are still underway, and EnergyTrend believes that the polysilicon contract price trend in 2012 will depend on the stance of downstream makers – wafer manufacturers in particular.
	This week’s wafer prices stayed flat. As for the market trend, high efficiency products and standard products currently show a price gap of around 10-20%. As the market proportion of high efficiency products continues to increase, spot price will be affected significantly. Additionally, most manufacturers have already cleared their inventories and thus have no desire to lower price further. As a result, this week’s prices remained stable, with slight signs of recovery.
	 
	Moreover, according to EnergyTrend, most downstream makers are relatively optimistic towards the market trend in 2012, believing the decreased demand in European markets will be limited while Chinese and Japanese markets will see obvious growth and mid-to-small manufacturers’ temporary production shutdown, all of which the industry believes will help stabilize the PV industry supply. In addition, China has proposed an appropriate policy to support the development of the polysilicon industry. Therefore, EnergyTrendd believes that Chinese government is ready to intervene with the market and companies lacking economies of scale and competitive advantages will likely be forced into mergers and acquisitions or driven out of business. With currently many western manufacturers temporarily shutting down part of capacity to alleviate pressure from decreasing polysilicon price, upstream manufacturers are already planning to increase contract price in 2012.
	 
	The Intersolar India exhibition that came to a conclusion last week without much of encouraging news. The market has seen prices lower than US$0.45/Watt for solar cell products from Indian manufacturers, but their quality and conversion efficiency need further confirmation. Although the quoted prices have not currently affected mainstream market price, India has enormous market potential and government policies to support the development of the solar cell and module industry. EnergyTrend believes that in the future Indian makers’ influence on mainstream spot and contract price is sure to gradually increase.

According to EnergyTrend, TrendForce’s green energy research division, there is a division among current spot market price trends – solar cell and module prices have ceased falling and stabilized, while polysilicon and Si wafer prices are showing signs of an uptrend. As for the contract price trend in 2012, there has been talk of polysilicon and Si wafer price increases, but currently buyers and vendors are not seeing eye to eye on the matter. Related manufacturers indicate the market trend for 2012 is unclear, which does not generally favor price increases. Therefore, EnergyTrend believes it is unlikely that contract price will see an increase in 2012.
	This week’s polysilicon price increased significantly. EnergyTrend believes that the wide range is attributable to the gradual increase of high efficiency Si wafer demand, which has pulled polysilicon price up as well. On the other hand, with clients demanding higher quality, some polysilicon makers are unable to provide clients with products that fulfill their requirements, and can only target the standard market by offering lower prices.
	This week’s Si wafer price also saw a slight increase. According to EnergyTrend research, currently downstream solar cell clients are focusing on proprietary high efficiency products. Some top-tier makers are even focusing all product planning for 2012 on high efficiency products. Furthermore, as some Si wafer manufacturers as unable to increase high efficiency product capacity and the yield rate, high efficiency products and standard products currently have a price gap of approximately US$0.2/piece. The high efficiency wafer demand increase is the cause of this week’s slight price increases.
	As for contract price, vendors are slightly more straightforward. Currently, a major manufacturer located in Asia has quoted a price of approximately US$30/kg for polysilicon price in 2012. In terms of Si wafers, related vendors indicate that the target average contract price for 2012 will be US$1.2/piece. This represents a price gap of 10% - 20% between standard and high efficiency products. As for buyers, related vendors indicate that the European market price has not improved, inventory has not yet been cleared, and cost has not been transferred to the client-end. Thus, the overall situation is not conducive to a price increase.

NB Battery’s Stagnant Demand Showed Signs of Rebound
According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, due to the persisting weak demand for notebook in December 2011 and the initial production downsizing taking effect, the price drop of battery cells has decreased to below 1.5%. However, in addition to the uncertain economic outlook, the standstill of assorted components’ development and the lack of new notebooks releases by the big brands stagnated the market, which resulted in the bleak demand that continued to impede battery makers.
Nonetheless, based on the shipments of components including battery, the market has shown a minor demand surge, which EnergyTrend refers to the fewer working days in January 2012 due to the Chinese New Year holiday and the expected labor shortage in February. The impending Chinese New Year holiday revived the dreary market outlook.
Lithium Polymer Battery Cell Prices Experienced More Drastic Drop
At present, iPad, Kindle Fire and Galaxy Tab are the stars in the tablet market, and each of them owns a fair amount of market share, which changes the landscape of the tablet PC market that used to be dominated by one particular product. Under the circumstances, the dynamics of the battery cell market started to shift as the Chinese lithium polymer battery makers took more aggressive actions. To further the difference between products, top-tier manufacturers have increased the energy density and lifespan of their lithium polymer battery cells, which will in turn cause their prices to go up. Enhancingthe products while maintaining consumer-friendly prices becomesa new focus of the industry.
As for the mainstream products such as iPad, the demand for components decreased considerably as it entered the transitional period, which caused the prices of lithium polymer batteries to dip by about 2% averagely. It marked the first time in 2011 the lithium polymer battery cell prices plummeted more than lithium cylindrical ones.
Looking toward 2012, the demand and supply and price changes of lithium polymer battery cells will affect whether the thin type batteries can develop well with the progression of operating systems and processors. Moreover, the new products stir up a change in the cylindrical battery industry. Whether or not Taiwanese battery pack makers are able to win business from the big names in terms of new products and the shift in supply status are the worth noting issues in 2012.

Benefiting from the rush orders from clients in Europe and the United States, Taiwanese solar cell makers’ utilization rates increased evidently, which will affect the future development of contract and spot prices. According to TrendForce,  EnergyTrend’s survey, the contract price of polysilicon is still in negotiation as the buyers and suppliers are yet to reach a consensus. On the other hand, due to the utilization rate surge of solar cell makers propelled by rush orders, polysilicon suppliers took this opportunity to jack up the contract price, which affected the spot market and caused the polysilicon spot price this week to remain on an uptrend.
	As for the contract price, according to EnergyTrend, Asian polysilicon suppliers are leaning towards raising the price while the European and the US suppliers are maintaining the current prices. The major manufacturers expect the contract price in January to fall between US$27/kg and US$30/kg, EnergyTrend has learned. However, the downstream companies are still suffering from deficits and are unlikely to burden their clients with increased costs. Therefore, thus far little prospect is seen for a price surge; whether or not the contract price can be increased to US$30/kg remains to be seen.

Due to continual orders from North American regions, solar cell makers’ capacity utilization rate has increased in January. Additionally, the end of holiday vacations brings more price inquiries from European clients, increasing trading activity on the market. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, as order visibility has increased and supply has tightened due to the transition of demand to high efficiency products, suppliers are gradually regaining the upper-hand in terms of prices. In consideration of the current supply and demand situation as well as the price trend, 1Q12 price will see incremental price increases.
 EnergyTrend has confirmed the rising polysilicon price trend. According to EnergyTrend, many top-tier makers have already concluded Q1 contract price negotiations. Currently, only a few companies are still discussing details. In terms of contract price, makers have sold at prices of around $28-30/kg for priority clients, and US$30-40/kg for others. High-efficiency Si wafer demand remains strong, but currently only a portion of wafer makers are able to provide products with over 17% conversion efficiency. According to EnergyTrend, some Si wafer makers have already sold all of their January production and are engaging in price negotiations for February, a clear indication that high-efficiency products will remain in tight supply in the short term.
	Although Taiwanese solar cell makers’ capacity utilization rate has seen significant increases due to the influx of North American orders, EnergyTrend research indicates that most orders are large-scale solar system contracts. In consideration of overall costs and IRR (internal rate of return), currently demand for high efficiency products is not high, with standard products accounting for most of demand. Therefore, downstream solar cell and module makers are mostly quoting flat prices – prices have only been increased for a portion of high efficiency products, in order to test out the market. Furthermore, Chinese makers are still mainly providing standard products and quoting flat prices, resulting in a price trend discrepancy when it comes to different product quality. EnergyTrend believes that unless the market sees a major change, based on the currently supply and demand status, in 1Q12 high efficiency products will see a gradual rise in price, while standard product price will stay flat.

As Germany’s installation volume for 4Q was unexpectedly high, inventory levels were adjusted significantly – some system makers’ stock levels had even fallen to recent lows. Meanwhile, affected by the uncertainty of Germany’s policies, demand momentum for 1Q12 may be similar to that of 4Q11. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, although European system manufacturers have already begun to place orders, their main priority is still inventory restocking. Since related manufacturers have been continuously receiving European system vendor orders, and previously placed North American orders are currently being shipped, polysilicon and silicon wafer demands are increasing simultaneously. 

	On the other hand, although Taiwanese solar cell makers’ shipment volume has increased, price has not followed suit. EnergyTrend research indicates, recently solar cell orders have mostly been urgent orders placed by Chinese module makers. While order volume is large, in order to be compatible with module manufacturing process, China makers’ own patterns must be used. Additionally, as most orders consist mainly of standard products (16.4%-16.8%), price remains low and these orders do not significantly benefit solar cell makers’ profitability. The main advantage to accepting these orders is the increase in capacity utilization rate.
	Furthermore, Chinese manufacturers previously cut capacity, which reduced supply volume. Now, as urgent orders flood in, supply still seems tight, which has caused the slight increase in standard product prices.
As for modules, this week’s module price stayed flat. Related vendors indicate that if upstream prices continue to rise, makers will have to transfer cost to the client end – whether or not they will be successful depends on the future development of the market.

As rush orders from Europe, North America, and China continue streaming in, the 1Q12 global solar market outlook has become more optimistic. EnergyTrend research indicates, as downstream orders flooded in, related vendors continued to receive orders and negotiate prices during the Chinese New Year vacation period. Even now, after the holiday period has ended, vendors’ product lines are at loaded capacity. The influx of rush orders that initially was expected to be a short-lived phenomenon is now certain to continue until the end of 1Q12, which has made related vendors more optimistic towards first quarter operations.
With regards to the supply side, related vendors believe the rapid price plummeting in 2011 separated the strong from the weak. According to EnergyTrend, the withdrawal of many small to mid-sized makers from the supply chain in 4Q as well as the downward adjustment of capacity by major makers ameliorated the oversupply situation to some extent. Furthermore, the quick rise in high-efficiency product demand also caused the gradual withdrawal of makers with inadequate technology from the mainstream market, which will help end unfavorable industry price slashing.
Furthermore, while the details of German and British subsidy cuts in 2012 remain unclear, the German subsidy policy is expected to be set in 2Q12. Therefore, system vendors will rush to increase installation volume before the next subsidy cut, which will help keep 1Q12 demand stable.
	According to EnergyTrend, Germany may adjust FIT subsidies on a monthly basis to prevent the subsidy cut induced installation wave such as that which occurred in December 2011. Whether or not total installation volume will be restricted or not is still in discussion, but related vendors are indicate that such a policy would be unlikely to pass this year. Overall, EnergyTrend believes suitable adjustments will benefit stable development of the German solar market, and demand changes this year are not expected to be large. Since there is also uncertainty about the UK’s FIT policy, currently installed systems may receive benefits based on the old FiT, which would result in strong demand for the UK market.

The Jan’12 prices of cylindrical lithium battery cells for notebooks remained unchanged.  EnergyTrend, the Green Energy research division of TrendForce, attributes the trend to the fact that manufacturers’ production cut strategies are starting to take effect. Moreover, manufacturers adjusted their production and stocked up components in January in response to the fewer workdays in February; stabilizing cylindrical lithium battery cells’ prices.
	Looking back at 2011, the total production of cylindrical battery cells amounted to 1.5 billion units. However, due to the capacity reduction in 4Q11, EnergyTrend estimated the production to decrease to 1.3 billion units in 2012; the downsizing has successfully stabilized the cylindrical lithium battery cells’ prices.
Lithium Polymer Cell Capacity Continues to Soar due to Tablet PC and Smartphone’s High Popularity
Due to the tablet PC and smartphone’s strong sales, 2011 is a fruitful year for the lithium polymer battery cell industry. The cell capacities, whose small size catering to the consumer-based products’ needs, has been increasing in order to meet the high demand. Lithium polymer cell’s production is expected to increase from 450 million units in 2011 to 600 million units in 2012, representing a 33% growth, which will help balance the supply and demand in 2012.
	EnergyTrend indicates that if the consumer electronic product makers focus more on a certain specification and size as opposed to several specifications , the industry will have a better chance to reach a balanced supply and demand. Many OEM and ODM makers have gradually unified the amount of specifications they manufacture, while ultrabooks will be the new focus of competition. On account of the decreasing number of new products, demand for different lithium battery specification requests is expected to be simplified and  be minimized over time.

According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, Europe and China may further reduce the subsidies. With companies trying to take advantage of subsidies while they can, the prospects for the global solar market are looking up for 1Q12, and the spot prices are also on an upswing. However, the upward price trend may cause uncertainty to the market outlook in 2Q12, as a certain amount of orders have been advanced to 1Q12. The subsidy reduction in 2Q12 will render the companies conservative.
At present, European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Greece, and Switzerland have announced their new subsidy policies. For example, Germany may reduce the subsidy by 12%-24% in 2Q12, which will result in the same strong demand for 1Q12 as that for 11’Dec; the same goes for Greece and Switzerland. Although China is said to reduce its subsidy as well, due to the fact that the domestic demand in China is mainly supplied by the Chinese manufacturers, China’s subsidy cut plays little part in the global market.

According to EnergyTrend, the green energy division of TrendForce, benefitting from the rush orders in Q1, first-tier manufacturers managed to keep their capacity utilization rate above 80% while second-tier manufacturers above 50%. Although manufacturers take an optimistic attitude towards 1Q12, there are some factors affecting the solar industry development. First, system manufacturers’ installation progress has been delayed as snowy weather continues to grip Europe. Second, rumors of Energy Conversion Devices (ECD)’ bankruptcy have put solar industry development in doubt.
As severe snow storms have descended on Europe for days, most solar markets, including Germany, are putting their system installation on hold. However, EnergyTrend research indicated that the harsh weather has not stopped system manufacturers from pulling inventory. They expressed that system vendor’s  sales channels were spread mainly across the European markets, which allowed them to adjust modules supply orderly based on demand and to resume installation when weather is less severe in Germany.
	 
	Nevertheless, it is worth paying attention to whether small or medium system manufacturers without sales channels are affected by the weather, with inherent inventory accumulation that brings financial is cutting subsidy in April. An estimate based on information from several sources puts the reduction at about 10% to 15%. EnergyTrend estimated that in order to prevent further loss on inventory valuation caused by the weather, orders will reach its peak by the end of February or early March.
	 
	On the other hand, ECD, Uni-Solar’s parent company, filed for bankruptcy, have raised concerns in the PV industry development. Uni-Solar focused on flexible thin-film, according to EnergyTrend’s survey, their target market remains the niche market segment, focused on the U.S. and European roof-tops. Since ECD has faced management problems for a while, the declaration of bankruptcy is just a matter of time. PV manufacturers indicated that this incident does not have a significant impact on the PV industry development. However, it is important to further follow-up on whether Uni-Solar can be sold successfully as well as the final buyer’s background.

Benefitting from the continual influx of rush orders, Taiwanese manufacturers have had their hands full in Q1. While the industry is wondering whether this will continue into Q2 or not, according to research by EnergyTrend, TrendForce's green energy research division, makers have already begun negotiating orders for April. As some makers have even initiated discussion with clients about long-term OEM project, makers indicate visibility is satisfactory for the time being. Related vendors are extremely conservative towards the current market, and unwilling to make conclusive statements about the Q2 outlook.
	Affected by EU and U.S. antidumping lawsuits, the number of Chinese PV makers turning to cooperate with Taiwanese manufacturers has increased significantly, but activity has been limited to the midstream solar cell and module sector. According to EnergyTrend, currently Chinese manufacturers are either adopting direct investment or establishing new companies by joint venture in Taiwan. Although Chinese makers’ movements in Taiwan are preparations for the storm, related vendors indicate that the expansion of capacity and human resources will still depend on future order status. Currently, major Taiwanese makers’ product lines and human resources are currently at 80-90%. First-tier manufacturers’ annualized capacity remains fully loaded, while second and third-tier makers are utilizing over 60% capacity.

Under Germany’s new policy, rooftop system subsidies will be cut by 20-30%, while ground-mounted systems below 10MW will see a 25% reduction; over 10MW will no longer receive support. Furthermore, beginning in May 2012 subsidies will be cut by €0.15/kWh monthly until January 1, 2013.

 PV Expo Japan Highlights High-Efficiency Products, Makers Anticipate July 2012 Orders from Japanese Market
	The three-day long PV Expo Japan event has begun, marking the first international PV exhibit since Germany’s policy changes. Furthermore, beginning in July 2012 Japan will implement a large-scale ground-mounted system subsidy policy. Thus, global makers congregated at the expo are eagerly swapping opinions and seizing opportunities to penetrate the Japanese market. According to EnergyTrend’s onsite reports, high-efficiency products are the main attraction at this year’s PV Expo Japan. Taking into consideration Japan’s renewed growth momentum, high-efficiency product supply and demand will be an important indicator of the solar market in 2Q12.
	The industry supply chain has also seen changes. According to EnergyTrend observation, Taiwanese groups previously rumored to be looking into investing in the solar industry have begun setting the stage, choosing sectors with related resources as their entry point. EnergyTrend believes this change is an indication that the PV industry is headed in a collective direction, utilizing group resources and power to integrate the industry chain both vertically and horizontally, thereby increasing profitability. As cost control is the current industry focus, the entrance of Taiwanese groups is expected to have a deep impact not only on both sides of the strait, but globally as well.

According to EnergyTrend’s survey, normal grade and high efficiency products were affected by the price downturn while other products’ prices stayed flat.
According to EnergyTrend, last week, polysilicon related manufacturers became more aggressive about price quotes, and there was greater room for price negotiation. According to the information EnergyTrend gathered, second-tier polysilicon makers’ price quotes have come down to $25/kg, while the top four makers’ price quotes remained high. Related manufacturers stated that due to the production cut of Chinese polysilicon makers and the large amount of orders pouring in in early 1Q12, the recent shipments were mostly to fulfill the ongoing 1Q12 contract, and the demand in the spot market remained low. Manufacturers also indicated that if the pale outlook persists, they will likely further the price cut.

	As for wafer, clients took a sterner stance on price quotes as conservatism started to spread in the market. But the price gap between different products began to widen.
	As far as the midstream manufacturers are concerned, Taiwanese solar cell and module makers’ utilization rates stayed the same, but the companies still kept close track of their downstream clients' statuses. EnergyTrend points out that benefiting from the PV trade dispute between China and the United States, Taiwanese cell and module makers continue to receive orders. However, the bleak outlook in Europe and the impending verdict of the PV trade dispute renders the 2Q12 development conservative.
	As for this week’s spot prices, according to EnergyTrend, the bulk of shipments was from previous orders and the spot demand remained low, which saw the prices stay flat. However, clients have put the remaining shipment on hold and planned to renegotiate the prices.
Helped by certain manufacturers’ aggressiveness in price quotes and acquiring orders, this week’s solar cell and module ASP remained the same, while the price gap widened. EnergyTrend believes that as certain manufacturers’ proactive stance proved effective, other manufacturers will join the ranks, which will trigger fluctuations in the solar cell and module prices.

                                EnergyTrend: Market Purchase Momentum Weak, Price Falls Significantly                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20120315-3223.html,"

As the uncertainty concerning various market factors deepens, the PV market is in wait-and-see mode and buyers have noticeably taken a step back. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of  TrendForce, affected by a pessimistic European market outlook and anticipation of the upcoming decision regarding the investigations between the U.S. and China solar industries, mid and downstream solar cell and module makers have adjusted their stock levels in a simultaneous but unplanned move.
According to EnergyTrend, major solar cell manufacturers began decreasing their intake of polysilicon and silicon wafer inventory last week. This week, some makers have temporarily stopped stocking silicon wafers altogether. Related vendors indicate, inventory stocking momentum from downstream clients has gradually weakened since the German government announced solar subsidy cuts. Although shipments were normal for the first half of the month, clients are already asking for price adjustments, and high-efficiency product price has also begun falling. EnergyTrend surveys indicate, currently buyers’ contract price expectations are far lower than what vendors are able to provide. Furthermore, buyers have not noticeably reduced contract price for shipments that have already been delivered, causing a tug of war situation between both sides regarding concluded transaction price.
As for polysilicon, due to weak demand and aggressive inventory stocking earlier this year, market price continues to be at a low. According to EnergyTrend research, currently lowest price has fallen below US$25/kg. Related vendors believe that if 2Q demand continues to weaken, polysilicon spot price may have a chance to return to 4Q11 levels.
According to EnergyTrend research, currently makers have already begun price negotiations for 2HMar. or April, with estimated adjustments of approximately 10%. As for this week’s spot prices, affected by traders and a portion of makers aggressively clearing excess materials, polysilicon price remains on a downtrend， with lowest price arriving at US$24.5/kg, and average price at US$26.86/kg, a 5.36% decrease. Silicon wafer price decreased significantly, with average multi-Si wafer price falling by 4.75% to US$1.164/piece and average mono-Si wafer price at US$1.597/piece, a 1.24% decline. As for solar cells and modules, a portion of makers are aggressively making offers which has caused price adjustments – average solar cell price decreased 4.74% to US$0.502/Watt. Mono-wafer and high-efficiency product price fell noticeably as well, which will affect the solar cell trend in the future. In terms of modules, as there has been news of the Chinese government consolidating the industry in addition to weak demand and price slashing, this week’s average module price fell 2.98% to US$0.847/Watt. Impacted by the decline in module prices, thin film product price also showed a downtrend, with a 3.79% decrease.

                                EnergyTrend: U.S. Reaches Preliminary Decision on Solar Anti-Dumping Tariffs                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20120321-3266.html,"

The U.S. Department of Commerce has reached a preliminary decision regarding anti-dumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) petitions against Chinese solar makers. Punitive duties on imports to the U.S. are set below 5%, lower than generally expected - Suntech will face tariffs of 2.9%, Changzhou Trina Solar Energy 4.73%, and all other Chinese manufacturers 3.59%. The U.S.’s anti-dumping ruling will be announced on May 17, and EnergyTrend, green energy research division of TrendForce, believes the combined AD and CVD tariffs may be lower than 20% - currently it seems like all the commotion surrounding the lawsuits was unwarranted.
EnergyTrend analyzes the preliminary ruling from three perspectives: the status of China’s solar industry, the relationship between Chinese and Taiwanese vendors, and how this will affect the anti-dumping ruling.
 1) Status of China’s Solar Industry
	According to EnergyTrend, China’s second and third-tier solar panel manufacturers are not adept at taking orders themselves – the majority rely on orders outsourced by major makers. As a precaution against the U.S. AD and CVD lawsuits, Chinese manufacturers began moving production to Taiwan at the end of 2011, negatively affecting China’s second and third-tier makers. As the anti-dumping decision will not be reached until mid-May and the market currently remains in a state of oversupply, EnergyTrend believes major manufacturers will not significantly increase order volume to second and third-tier makers before May, which means the smaller makers will continue to suffer in the short term.
 2) China-Taiwan Cooperation
	As demand from the North American market is currently strong, it is unlikely Chinese manufacturers will give up on such a lucrative opportunity. According to EnergyTrend research, prior to the the AD ruling in May, Chinese makers will continue to maintain the same amount of outsourcing to Taiwanese manufacturers. Furthermore, the Taiwanese government recently decided to allow Chinese vendors to invest in the Taiwanese solar industry, a move that EnergyTrend believes will deepen cooperative ties between China and Taiwan.
 3) Influence on the Anti-dumping Ruling
	As the U.S. government’s punitive tariffs are largely symbolic so far, EnergyTrend believes there is a chance China will also be let off easily in May’s anti-dumping decision, with combined duties amounting to less than 20%.
	As punitive tarrifs are set below 5%, and manufacturers’ production cost is already close to breaking even, EnergyTrend believes industry vendors will raise their selling prices to deal with the changes. From the cost perspective, according to EnergyTrend calculations, total cost for outsourced production is 10-20% more than China vendors’ own manufacturing cost. If the combined AD and CVD tarrifs are less than 20%, EnergyTrend believes Chinese manufacturers will maintain the current level of outsourcing to Taiwanese makers. Taiwanese manufacturers’ orders will continue to increase after May.

                                EnergyTrend: Germany’s Revised Solar Subsidy Policy to Bring Short-Term Gains, Potential Long-Term Losses                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20120329-3300.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, the research division of TrendForce, Germany’s ruling coalition has come to a consensus regarding the nation’s revised photovoltaic subsidy policy. In addition to partial subsidy adjustments, an installation cap is also being implemented. According to EnergyTrend research, the German government has laid out the initial progressive feed-in-tariff (FiT) reduction schedule for 2012-2017. If the number of installations falls above or below the target range, figures will be adjusted accordingly.
The current revisions to Germany’s solar subsidy policy consist mainly of subsidy amount changes and installation capacity limitations. As for subsidy adjustments, a transitional arrangement will be available for developers who submit planning applications before February 24; small systems installed prior to June 30 and large systems installed before September 30 will fall under the old subsidy conditions. In terms of monthly adjustments, the revised policy states that beginning in May, the FiT reductions will be a set percentage instead of a fixed amount – a 1% reduction per month, as opposed to the previous €15/kWh. Furthermore, changes have also been made to the market integration model. Beginning on January 1, 2013, rooftop systems up to 10 kW will only be subsidized for 80% of generated electricity, as opposed to the previous 85%; 90% of generated electricity will be subsidized for systems between 10 kW and 1 MW, while installations over 1 MW will be fully subsidized.
	 
EnergyTrend believes these changes will benefit the stabilization of the German solar industry in 2012. As the new policy provides a transitional period for photovoltaic developers, the current wave of installations may continue until the end of Q3. Q4 demand will depend on the future direction of the new policy as well as investment returns. Looking beyond 2013, as the FiT reductions will be based on actual installation figures – the draft allows for a 29% reduction at most – vendors are currently leaning towards reducing capacity to sustain market price. Thus, EnergyTrend believes demand momentum will gradually decrease, and if the revised draft is passed, Germany’s photovoltaic market will see short-term gains but long-term losses.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, solar PV market demand has plummeted recently due to the passing of Germany’s new subsidy policy, in addition to news of the Italian government’s plans to shrink solar subsidies also. Furthermore, as the anti-dumping duties imposed on China by the U.S. are lower than generally expected, it is said that Taiwanese module makers have been asked to temporarily suspend shipments. With the steady news of unfavorable market factors, this week’s spot prices saw significant adjustments.
	PV vendors indicate, currently the Italian government’s policy draft plans for significant solar subsidy cuts – the new policy is expected to be passed in mid-2012. Furthermore, as Germany’s new subsidy policy officially took effect on April 1, market demand has been on a steady downward slide for the past two weeks. As buyers’ price expectations are a far cry from what vendors are prepared to offer, the spot market is looking somewhat barren.

EnergyTrend research indicates, currently solar cell manufacturers are keeping stock levels around one week’s worth or so. Some module makers have received requests from clients to temporarily suspend shipments, but whether or not the orders will be cancelled is unclear as of yet. Additionally, manufacturers have lowered capacity utilization rates significantly, and are conservative towards Q2 levels. Makers are engaging in strict inventory management to prevent losses due to excess stock.

Apple’s new iPad has arrived, and its influence on end market and component part product price is gradually taking effect. According to EnergyTrend, green energy research division of TrendForce, market demand for lithium polymer batteries is increasing due to higher power needs, which in turn is causing battery cell unit price to fall.
 Apple Products to Stimulate Lithium Polymer Battery Demand Significantly
	The highly anticipated new iPad has finally arrived. It uses the same lithium polymer batteries as its predecessor, but to accommodate the increased power needs of the high-resolution display, 4G data transfer, etc., battery capacity has been upgraded from 2300 mAh to 3800 mAh, a 65% increase.
	Lithium polymer batteries have always been highly customizable, but because of the wide variation and low volume of early mobile phones, makers were conservative in terms of capacity and supply. However, the improved hardware specification that has come with the popularity of Apple’s iPad, as well as the elevated power requirements of tablet PCs and smartphones, will benefit lithium polymer battery demand.
	As for system design, the new iPad’s battery still consists of a one in series, three in parallel (1s3p) configuration,so there is little difference in the battery protection board. Battery pack yield rate will face a bit of a challenge, but overall the product trend is a boon to battery makers.
 Figure 1. Comparison of iPad 2 and new iPad batteries

 Figure 2. New iPad shipments

 Large Lithium Polymer Battery Demand on the Rise
	Led by Apple, demand for large lithium polymer batteries has soared in applications from new tablet PCs to ultrabooks. In terms of the manufacturing process, there are no significant differences between large and small lithium polymer batteries – the yield rate difficulties caused by the thinner form factor is still the main issue. However, according to EnergyTrend, currently manufacturers have not yet hit a bottleneck in terms of production capacity.
	Looking at Q2 2012 supply and demand, based on scheduled arrivals of new tablet PC and ultrabook models, demand will increase significantly. This will in turn raise the capacity utilization rate for battery product lines, and large lithium polymer batteries will begin to see significant price reductions.
	Furthermore, according to EnergyTrend research, as many new products from manufacturers are still in the initial stages, there is enough capacity to meet demand. Thus, demand-induced price reductions are unlikely in the short term, but in the future when capacity increases, to the point that supply is tight, the industry will see price reductions – the situation will become clearer after Q2 2012.

                                EnergyTrend: Lesson Learned, Solar Manufacturers No Longer Slashing Price to Bring In Orders                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20120412-3375.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, slowed demand on the German market, the uncertainty towards the future market in Italy, and unclear demand in other regions has resulted in fewer deals on the spot market. However, the situation is an improvement over last year – as manufacturers are no longer blindly slashing price to bring in orders, spot price is stable.
Related vendors indicate, with the current price trend, it is unlikely that wafer and solar cell makers will be able to avoid losses – thus, minimizing losses is the issue at hand. Manufacturers point out the lesson learned last year: when demand is weak, steep price cuts will not necessarily secure orders, and may even bring high risk to all manufacturers’ operations. TrendForce indicates, during China’s mini Golden Week in early April, many Chinese manufacturers went to Taiwan to negotiate outsourced orders. Most manufacturers are setting last year’s prices as their low – currently there has been no news of makers agreeing to orders at rates lower than last year’s, resulting in a repeat of an unfortunate situation: the more produced, the more losses suffered.
As the rapidly declining price approaches last year's low and market demand in sluggish, before Italy's subsidy cuts are finalized and there is a rush to install, the outlook for the solar industry is gloomy. TrendForce interviews indicate, the European market is waiting for the final decision on Italy's solar policy, while manufacturers for the North American market indicate that the proportion of China's manufacturing outsourced to Taiwan is currently low. The Chinese makers are maintaining shipment flexibility in preparation by outsourcing a portion of production for upcoming changes. As the U.S. anti-dumping decision and Italy's new subsidy policy will be revealed in Q2, TrendForce expects more changes will take place in the second half of April.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, German market demand is relatively weak. On the Italian market, however, demand momentum is recovering as the government is planning for further subsidy cuts in 2H12. TrendForce surveys indicate, there are manufacturers currently receiving orders from the Italian market, but the majority are short-term orders.
Industry vendors indicate, orders from the Italian market started coming in last week. Initially vendors assumed it was a one-time rush, but they continued to receive orders after the first wave. While order volume was not especially high, the influx is an indication that demand on the Italian market will see a turnaround in Q2. Solar inverters are seeing the same phenomenon as solar modules. Inverter demand is based on system installation demand, thus more accurately reflecting actual market status. According to interviews with industry players, solar inverter manufacturers have indeed received orders from the Italian market, but shipment due dates are all set before June, an indication that Italian clients believe further subsidy cuts will in fact be implemented in the second half of the year. Therefore, there may be a rush of installations on the Italian market in Q2.
Although order demand has recovered somewhat and market price has stabilized, quotes continue to hover around the low end of the spectrum. Related vendors indicate, at present the industry is engaging in strict cost control – any excess materials are being cleared to avoid price decline due to surplus inventory. According to TrendForce surveys, while some manufacturers remain firm on price quotes, there is little demand at such price points. Furthermore, the aforementioned vendors are aggressively selling excess inventory on the spot market – thus, while the spot market has stabilized, prices remain low, with no sign of rebound.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, polysilicon spot price is closing in on major vendors’ manufacturing cost – this week’s spot price has already fallen below the US$23/kg mark, but vendors indicate polysilicon price is gradually stabilizing. TrendForce believes polysilicon price may hit US$20/kg this year, but as first-tier makers are standing firm on price, second and third-tier manufacturers are unable to make a move on their own. Thus, TrendForce expects polysilicon price will stay above US$20/kg.
	Industry players indicate, polysilicon price will continue to fall mainly due to continuous production. Unwilling to hold on to too much inventory, contract-bound makers continue to sell raw materials. Without a significant improvement in market demand, this much supply will likely keep polysilicon market price low, maintaining the downward trend.
	Vendors indicate the four main polysilicon suppliers are all highly cost competitive, leaving little breathing room for smaller makers. While there are some manufacturers that want to stabilize price, others are aggressively pushing price down to expedite the elimination of weaker suppliers. Makers with cost advantage and capacity covered by contracts will adjust their product retail prices in accordance with their main competitors. TrendForce expects the market price will be led by the price-cutting makers – with manufacturing cost around US$19-20, suppliers will still see 5-10% profit margins.
	 
	In 2012, TrendForce forecasts contract price will be around US$26-28, while spot price will see a low of US$19.5-22.5. Polysilison suppliers are unlikely to follow in the footsteps of cell and wafer makers, especially since installation volume is expected to increase slightly this year. Furthermore, as there has been little news of polysilicon makers resuming halted production, it is probable polysilicon price will stay above US$20/kg.

The month of April brought many changes for the global polysilicon industry. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the polysilicon industry is becoming increasingly polarized. With a competitive advantage in terms of capital, cost, and technology, top-tier makers continue to expand capacity while small and medium manufacturers are facing halted production, possibly even bankruptcy. TrendForce believes the polysilicon industry will grow more competitive by the day, illustrating the truth of the old adage “survival of the fittest”.
According to TrendForce, Canadian polysilicon and UMG (upgraded metallurgical) silicon manufacturer Timminco declared bankruptcy at the end of April, but German polysilicon giant Wacker Chemie AG has not been daunted by the weak market and continues with its capacity expansion plans. Wacker indicates, their new polysilicon facility in Nünchritz, Germany boasts a capacity of 15,000 metric tons and will begin mass production in Q2 – yearly capacity is expected to reach 52,000 metric tons by the end of 2012. Meanwhile, construction continues on the maker’s new Tennessee plant. The U.S. facility is expected to begin mass production in 2014, which will bring Wacker’s total polysilicon capacity to 70,000 metric tons. Wacker indicates, as clients are demanding higher polysilicon quality standards, the supplier’s capacity is almost completely under contract until the end of 2015. Small and medium polysilicon manufacturers, on the other hand, are focusing mainly on spot market business. As price fluctuates rapidly and makers have hit a bottleneck in terms of cost and technology, they continue to sustain heavy losses – if there is a break in suppliers’ flow of capital, bankruptcy will be inevitable.
Industry players indicate, the major polysilicon suppliers are currently focusing on contract sales, as it is more cost advantageous and reduces the risk from price fluctuations. The current contract price trend for first-tier makers falls in the US$25-30 range. TrendForce indicates this price range is optimal for small and medium manufacturers’ costs, but first-tier suppliers still have the flexibility to offer clients lower prices.

Recent elections in Europe ushered in uncertainty for the solar market, and the new subsidy policies to take effect in 2H12 also rendered players conservative. According to EnergyTrend, the solar research division of TrendForce, orders for solar modules will continue to pour in till mid-May, while orders for solar cells will persist till early June. When asked about the orders in 2H’June, related manufacturers stated that given the cutthroat competition, companies still walk on thin ice, not to mention that any market noise could cost them orders from clients. Unless the murky outlook turns clear, conservatism will keep on dominating the downstream solar industry.
Moreover, related manufacturers pointed out that the orders in 2Q12 are most likely to pour in well into early June, while orders in 3Q12 and 4Q12 will start emerging at InterSolar Europe 2012, which will commence on June 13-15, 2012. However, spurred by the subsidy changes, German and Italian solar markets have seen strong demand surges in 1H12. Related companies indicated that Germany’s installed solar capacity in 1H12 is expected to amount to 3GW. Nonetheless, due to the fact that the booming growth in 1H12 is attributed to the large subsidy cuts set to become effective in 2H12, countries which have seen steep upswings in installed solar capacities in 1H12 are likely to undergo setbacks in 2H12. On the other hand, rumor has it that solar prices will dip soon. Yet, according to TrendForce’s survey, the current spot prices are already below the manufacturing costs. Aside from a number of manufacturers offering low prices for certain clients, the current spot prices will most likely stay flat.

	In terms of utilization rate, according to TrendForce, currently most major solar makers are at full capacity. Chinese first-tier solar module makers Trina Solar, JA Solar, and Suntech Power are all packed to capacity, while Taiwanese top solar cell makers’ utilization rates are well above 80%, which indicates the solar companies are striving to catch up with the 2Q12 orders. However, certain manufacturers are still concerned about the outlook after June. Manufacturers stated that most orders in 1H12 have been placed, but major makers’ utilization rates still remain high. Given the post-June uncertainty and a high likelihood of high utilization rates persisting, spot prices may plunge even further.

The SNEC International Solar and PV Conference & Exhibition, in session from May 16 to 18, is taking up all 17 halls at the Shanghai New International Expo Centre. The size of the exhibition has multiplied since last year, an indication that China’s market potential is widely recognized. During yesterday’s Asian PV Industry Summit, prominent industry figures such as Suntech Power's Dr. Shi Zhengrong, China Electric Equipment Group’s CEO Cai Zhifang, and Canadian Solar Inc.’s Chairman and CEO Dr. Shawn Qu, as well as major manufacturers from Europe and the U.S. all indicate cost is the main factor in global PC industry development. The realization of cost optimization through grid parity remains the foremost goal for the solar industry.
According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, interviews with many industry heavyweights indicate, the current cost structure renders a BOS (balance-of-system) price decrease unlikely in the short term. Therefore, the only way to lower system price is to start with the module portion – as such, improving module manufacturing cost and conversion rate are two important points for vendors. However, vendors indicate there is little room for improvement in terms of manufacturing cost due to the fact that raw material cost will not change anytime soon, so they will focus their efforts on improving efficiency. According to TrendForce, a 1% conversion rate increase translates to a 5-6% module cost reduction – this formula explains why high-efficiency product price has been less susceptible to decline compared to other products.
According to TrendForce reports from the exhibition site, the market outlook for the second half of the year is conservatively optimistic. Vendors believe price and installations on  major markets are being controlled by policy – if there are unexpected changes on the market, stricter policies will be enacted to guide the market back to a normal state. Therefore, vendors believe price will not see drastic changes in the future, and profits will mainly come from cost structure improvement.

On May 17, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its preliminary decision regarding anti-dumping charges against China’s solar cell and module makers. Anti-dumping duties imposed on China’s major solar cell manufacturers average 31.18%, with Suntech and Trina Solar receiving 31.22% and 31.14%, respectively. The remaining solar cell producers were hit with a high 249.96% tariff. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the U.S. used Thailand as a benchmark to determine tariff levels. However, data from China indicates that Thailand’s current capacity does not even amount to 1% of China’s total capacity – such a gross difference in capacity will naturally result in very different cost conditions, which puts into question whether or not Thailand is a suitable gauge in the investigation.
The tariffs set only include solar cells manufactured in China, not solar cells from third-parties that are used in modules produced in China. However, documentation is necessary to receive exemption from anti-dumping duties upon import.
In light of this development, TrendForce believes that as total tax has reached 35%, far higher than makers’ expectation of 15-20%, Taiwanese manufacturers will benefit from transferred orders. Chinese suppliers will also increase the proportion of orders they place with Taiwanese manufacturers, with solar cell makers taking the bulk of orders. Additionally, Taiwan’s domestic module makers will benefit from a portion of shipments heading to the U.S. In terms of price, as industry players have been in wait-and-see mode for nearly two weeks now and most makers’ capacity utilization rate exceeded 80% in May, price will inevitably increase, marking the first time the Taiwanese PV market has seen a price increase this year.
In addition to the imminent price increase, the anti-dumping ruling has long-term implications as well. For instance, China’s potential counterstrategies include finding a small solar cell maker in the U.S. that has gone bankrupt but still has the necessary equipment for China to produce solar cells locally. Another possibility would be to construct a new solar cell plant outside of China, but the  payback period is long for such an endeavor, and the current market is unsuitable for capacity expansion. Therefore, it is unlikely any strategic investments will be made before the final results of the investigation are announced at the end of November.
As of Q2, this year’s global demand volume is estimated at 26.5GW. However, currently it looks as if U.S. demand in the first half of the year will be stronger than expected – the U.S. demand forecast is increased from 3.5GW to around 5GW for 2012, which will stimulate global demand as the U.S. accounts for 17% of the global market. Furthermore, Taiwan’s total solar cell capacity is currently around 8GW, and Taiwanese manufacturers make the majority of China’s outsourced production.  In the short term, the supply and demand status as well as the current market expectation will cause price to rise, and the PV market price slashing caused by oversupply will continue.

	As the decision was in regards to solar cells from China, module products imported to the U.S. must use non-China solar cells to evade the tariffs – Taiwan stands to benefit the most from the situation. According to TrendForce research, there have been rumors of Taiwanese solar cell manufacturers raising prices for outsourced production, but as of yet no one has officially done so.

Last Friday’s (May 18) results for the preliminary ruling on the U.S. anti-dumping and anti-countervailing case against China were not what the PV industry expected, and Chinese manufacturers were caught off guard by the news, resulting in delayed price negotiations for June. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, related vendors indicate 2HMay and June price negotiations are still taking place.
As the decision was in regards to solar cells from China, module products imported to the U.S. must use non-China solar cells to evade the tariffs – Taiwan stands to benefit the most from the situation. According to TrendForce research, there have been rumors of Taiwanese solar cell manufacturers raising prices for outsourced production, but as of yet no one has officially done so.

Cylindrical Lithium Battery Demand Picking Up
Given that lithium polymer battery and ultrabook are inseparable, ultrabook prompts the battery to be “ultra slim.” Despite many ultrabook brands’ high popularity, lithium polymer battery’s high cost will still prevent it from reaching wide adoption. In the meantime, traditional notebook market sees upswing stimulated by the release of Intel processor and old notebooks with old Intel processors on sales.

The upgrade from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge has provided a welcoming boost to component suppliers. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, the demand has been climbing since March, 2012. Certain more aggressive PC assembly companies even already received orders for 3Q12.
Cylindrical Lithium Battery on Tight Supply with Price Staying Flat
Traditional notebook market sees demand surge due to the release of new processors. According to TrendForce, currently the market still needs to go through a transition phase (new processor with old OS), and the players make acquiring market share and increasing brand awareness the first priority. During the transition phase, the market demand will not positively reflect on lithium battery prices.
Lithium battery prices always fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Due to the conservative outlook for 2Q12, the prices stayed flat, so did the amount of orders from component suppliers. As a result, assorted components are currently on a tight supply, and whether or not the prices will change remains to be seen.

According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, given the preliminary ruling on the U.S. anti-dumping and anti-countervailing case against China and the traditional peak season for solar installation, the orders have been pouring in and the price quotes from Taiwanese solar cell makers climbed. 
The price uptrend may even affect the upstream wafer makers. Upstream players stated that they have heard that the downstream players attempted to jack up prices, and they have tried to confirm if the price quotes were truly the closing prices. On the other hand, wafer manufacturers also prepared to increase the price quotes, and have tested the market demand by increasing price quotes on certain clients but received negative feedback. The clients used the flat prices in China as an excuse to ask the wafer manufacturers not to increase prices.
TrendForce indicates the short-term market development is in Taiwanese solar companies’ favor, therefore, the prices will likely go up. However, the preliminary ruling on the U.S. anti-dumping and anti-countervailing case does not affect Chinese solar makers’ solar modules, which limits the growth momentum. TrendForce projects that solar cell prices will rise by 5%-10% and wafer prices by 3%-6%.

The Intersolar Europe exhibition will open its doors on June 13 in Munich, Germany – the conference began earlier, on June 11. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, prior to the exhibition some system vendors had already negotiated with suppliers and booked capacity, and related vendors indicate that this has continued. Additionally, as the latest news from Germany indicates its PV subsidy policy may be finalized sooner than expected, TrendForce believes another installation rush will take place on the German solar market. With the Japanese and the U.S. markets entering the peak season, TrendForce believes manufacturers should see revenue growth in Q2 and Q3.
According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, silicon wafer manufacturers in China lowered prices to bring in orders in the beginning of June, causing a price decline in the Chinese market. However, silicon wafer price stabilized this week due to demand recovery. Currently, as major silicon wafer makers in China continue to receive orders from Europe although they are at nearly fully loaded capacity, suppliers are relatively optimistic towards Q3. As for Taiwanese manufacturers, some have indicated that several European clients have already placed orders for July and August and accepted suppliers’ price increases. Demand is stemming mostly from high-efficiency products. Manufacturers indicate that the Japanese PV market, like its European counterpart, has entered the mature stage. The market for large systems like solar power plants is especially strong, and major manufacturers in China, Korea, and Japan have all geared up for the demand increase in the second half of the year.
The Intersolar exhibition will provide much insight into the European market in the second half of 2012. In consideration of the aforementioned market developments prior to the trade show, TrendForce expects the industry will see more rush orders in the near future. If economies in Europe remain stable, PV makers should see satisfactory revenue and profits in Q3.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, affected by economic instability in the eurozone, some European power plant investments have not progressed on schedule. Furthermore, Q3 order expectations were initially high, but prospects have changed after the conclusion of the Intersolar Europe exhibition. Although there have not been significant alterations to orders with Taiwanese manufacturers, and suppliers indicate all capacity is booked at the moment, whether orders will ship as scheduled is dependent on the market status in Q3. Regardless, some manufacturers indicate order volume fell below expectation, and the Q3 outlook remains uncertain. Downstream module prices continue to fluctuate, but wafer and solar cell prices remain on a slight uptrend, although the increase is slowing. It remains to be seen whether the fluctuations will continue in the short term.
In other news, the future development of the Asia PV market was a highlight of the recently concluded Intersolar Europe exhibition. With government support, a clear picture has emerged regarding the future of the Chinese and Japanese PV markets – prospects for the solar markets in Southeast Asia and India, on the other hand, are still uncertain. Both upstream and downstream vendors are seeking opportunities for cooperation, none more proactively than Chinese manufacturers. However, there remains a marked difference between upstream and downstream makers. Upstream suppliers continue to face severe competition, and manufacturers indicate that only those able to survive this round of competition will live to see brighter days in the PV industry.
As for this week’s price trends, figures were not as expected despite the increase in European orders. TrendForce believes this is due to worldwide markets continuing to monitor European capital market developments, and has caused the delay in power plant investments, in turn weakening demand. Furthermore, wafer and solar cell prices will continue to recover in the short term, but improving efficiency remains the key to price increases. Looking further ahead, however, the industry will remain in a state of oversupply, and manufacturers will still face pressure to lower prices as the industry continues to see subsidy cuts.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, while demand is recovering for PV industry orders in the second half of the year, price has yet to see a strong rebound, and vendors are placing more priority on unit price (USD/Watt) – to the extent that top-tier PV manufacturers are being meticulous down to the thousandths. Furthermore, as high-efficiency multi-Si wafers continue to improve and market price drops rapidly, the price to performance ratio for the product category has already surpassed that of traditional p-type mono-Si wafers. Industry vendors indicate, as the quality of high-efficiency multi-Si wafer products (including traditional high-efficiency and mono-like products) continues to improve, the p-type mono-Si wafer market will likely be eliminated.
Currently, efficiency for high-efficiency multi-wafer products is over 17.8%, while p-type mono-wafer efficiency is above 20%. In terms of raw material price, TrendForce data indicates that average price for high-efficiency multi-Si wafer and p-type mono-wafer products is around US$1.17/piece and US$1.48/piece, respectively. Looking at unit price, p-type mono-wafer products are still more expensive than high-efficiency multi-Si wafer products. Therefore, aside from specific customizations (color, wattage, etc.), TrendForce believes high-efficiency multi-Si wafer products will gradually cannibalize the p-type mono-wafer market. Based on mono-wafer shipment volumes, p-type products are still the mainstream at present. In addition to the impact from recent exchange rates, declining p-type product price has resulted in the continual downtrend of mono-Si wafer price.

Revisions to Germany’s ever-changing solar subsidy policy have finally been set; the final version however, is likely to further stagnate already shrinking demand in the European PV market, at least in the short term. EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, previously predicted Germany would include an overall subsidy cap in its new policy, and indeed lawmakers have done just that.
 
Source: EnergyTrend
	The German government has set a target cumulative installation capacity of 52GW by 2020. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, Germany’s solar installations amounted to 26.6GW, and the policy calls for a targeted growth corridor of 2.5 to 3.5GW per year. Installations in excess of these figures will not be subsidized. The revised policy also creates a new category for rooftop systems from 10 to 40kW, which will receive subsidies of €0.185/kWh. Systems smaller than 10kW or between 1MW and 10MW will be removed from the market integration model, and systems between 10kW and 1MW will be subsidized for 90% or power produced. Ground-mounted systems smaller than 10MW will continue to receive 100% subsidy.
	Although the impact of the new policy on Germany’s solar market will be mild, TrendForce believes that in the long run it will weaken Germany’s overall influence in the global PV market. As demand from Italy and other major European countries continues to shrink as well, when Germany enacts its 2.5 to 3.5 GW yearly installation cap in 2013 the global market will be see a total capacity reduction of 3GW. If market growth in China, Japan, and the U.S. is unable to make up for the cutback in Europe, the global PV industry will face an even tougher challenge beginning in 2013.
	Aside from negatively affecting the German and European solar markets, the new policy has caused manufacturers to adopt a conservative outlook toward the PV market in the second half of the year. According to TrendForce surveys, the current level of demand may be maintained in the third quarter, but prospects for the fourth quarter are far less optimistic. Furthermore, as end clients are placing more priority on price than efficiency, TrendForce has noted that demand is warming for standard products (efficiency between 16.8% and 17%). However, this turnaround has yet to benefit prices, and spot market figures continue to face pressure.
	Turning to this week’s spot prices, July negotiations are currently underway, but related vendors indicate prices have barely increased at all so far; most figures stayed flat, and some vendors even admitted to offering lower price quotes. Polysilicon prices from the four major PV makers fell in the US$20-22/kg range; some second-tier suppliers offered prices lower than US$20/kg, but no deals were concluded at such figures. Average polysilicon price has yet to stabilize, falling 0.71% to US$21.07/kg this week. As for silicon wafer price, although some manufacturers have all of their July capacity taken up, they still offered discounted prices to major clients. Average multi-Si wafer price fell to US$1.06/piece, a 0.65% decrease; mono-Si wafer price, dually affected by the exchange rate and high-efficiency products, average price dropped 0.67% to US$1.475/piece. As a result of a bear market, this week’s solar cell price trend saw a reversal with average price falling by 0.43% to $0.463/Watt. Also affected by the bear market, module price fluctuated this week, arriving at an average of US$0.745/Watt, a decrease of 0.27%.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the PV market is making a transition from an emphasis on high efficiency to products with higher price-performance ratio. Solar cell and module makers indicate clients are mainly showing demand for standard, as opposed to high-efficiency, products, resulting in a marked demand increase for multi-Si wafer products with 16.8-17% efficiency.
Improving efficiency has always been the trend in PV product development, while the current change in demand reflects how market needs contradict manufacturers’ interests. Industry manufacturers believe the occurrence is merely an anomaly, not indication that the pursuit of efficiency has ended. Production capacity for high-efficiency products is currently limited, which has prevented their prices from falling significantly. For standard products, on the other hand, supply currently exceeds demand, resulting in little price quotation differentiation between clients and a preference for products with higher price-performance ratio.
Affected by a conservative turn in the European market, some manufacturers have adopted a more moderate outlook for the second half of the third quarter. According to industry suppliers, demand visibility only extends to the middle of August; order status is unclear beyond that point. Manufacturers indicate all July capacity has already been taken, and shipments on the client end are on schedule. However, makers are still uncertain about August orders, though negotiations with clients are already underway. Manufacturers also indicate a change in focus; many are targeting the Japanese PV market. However, suppliers also note that while a surge in demand is expected due to government support, Japanese lawmakers may raise technology standards to slow international manufacturers’ entry to the Japanese PV market. Thus, future developments regarding the Japanese market are still up in the air.

According to EnergyTrend, TrendForce’s green energy division, although manufacturers have received a satisfactory amount of orders for July, vendors indicate August orders have decreased significantly due to PV subsidy policy changes in Europe. Furthermore, spot prices are showing a downtrend and EnergyTrend expects August price for products with 17-17.2% efficiency will fall below US$0.45/Watt, while 16.8-17% efficiency products will see prices lower than US$0.4/Watt.

Source: EnergyTrend
Shrinking PV subsidies in Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, etc. are affecting European clients’ operations; industry vendors indicate that as the bear market in Europe has resulted in sluggish business for some clients, August orders have decreased significantly. Furthermore, as the European market is expected to see sluggish growth in the second half of the year, manufacturers’ recent price quotes have shown considerable decline. Price quotes for 17% efficiency products have fallen to US$0.45/Watt, while 16.8% efficiency product price may fall below US$0.4/Watt; the rapid price decline has put clients in wait-and-see mode. Normally, August order negotiations should already be underway, but talks have been delayed. Suppliers indicate the extent of order decreases is unclear as of yet, but details will emerge towards the end of July.
As demand is falling on the European market and emerging market demand is not climbing rapidly enough to make up for the decrease in Europe, manufacturers have cut their capacity utilization rates significantly. According to TrendForce research, top manufacturers are currently using approximately 70 to 80% of total capacity, while second and third-tier makers are producing at around 60% capacity. While suppliers have high hopes for the Japanese PV market, demand growth will take time; at present, only a portion of manufacturers will be able to benefit from Japanese solar market growth to the point that they can maintain capacity.
This week’s spot prices fluctuated as suppliers were aggressive towards shipments due to the bleak market outlook. The majority of polysilicon deals were conducted in the US$20-21/kg range. The four major manufacturers saw prices arrive at US$19.5/kg, indication that suppliers are eager to clear inventory, no longer insisting on a bottom line for spot prices. Polysilicon prices continued to show a mild downtrend this week, with average price arriving at US$20.885/kg, a 0.76% decrease. As for silicon wafers, although the majority of manufacturers’ July capacity is already accounted for, some makers saw price adjustments due to the sluggish market, which resulted in a slight downtrend. Average multi-Si wafer price was US$1.062/piece, a 0.19% decrease. Average mono-Si wafer price, still suffering the double impact from weak demand and high-efficiency products, fell by 0.27% to US$1.466/piece. Average solar cell and module price dropped to US$1.466/piece, a 0.27% decrease. As for solar cells and modules, the gloomy outlook for the European market resulted in a significant price decrease this week; average solar cell and module price fell to US$0.458/Watt and US$0.744/Watt, respectively, representing decreases of 1.08% and 0.13%. Thin film products, affected by weak market demand and declining silicon module price, also saw a decreasing price trend; average price fell to US$0.712/Watt, a 1.25% reduction.

European solar companies have been negatively affected by Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria’s subsidies cuts. According to related manufacturers, European market outlook remains stagnant, and certain clients have delayed their payments and shipments. On the other hand, actual orders have yet to reflect climbing demand in China and Japan, not to mention that emerging markets have not taken off yet. As a result, companies have revised their forecast for 3Q12. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, related companies have adjusted their total orders for August downward by 10%-20%, while European orders saw a 5-10% decrease. Additionally, given the murky outlook for 2H12, August prices will see a sharp decline. Some manufacturers noted that non-standard product (referring to products with irregular specifications) prices will face a severe challenge to stay flat.

	On the other hand, despite the bleak market outlook, demand for non-standard products has been on a steep uptrend. According to EnergyTrend research, a price of $0.4/watt has appeared in the market, putting a lot of pressure on cell makers. However, major wafer makers’ capacities were not enough to supply the recent demand surge, which provided room for the small companies with less advanced technologies and lower yield rates to break into the supply chain and increase their market shares in the downstream sector. Related companies stated that as the climbing demand will most likely persist, price-performance ratio will be the key to acquiring orders. Standard product prices will see drastic fluctuations in August and September.
	This week’s spot prices continued to dip as the outlook turned lukewarm and companies started to digest their inventories. Major polysilicon makers’ spot prices have dropped to US$19/kg, indicating that companies had to make compromises in order to clear their inventories. Polysilicon prices continued to show a mild downtrend this week, with ASP arriving at US$20.835/kg, a 0.24% decrease. As for silicon wafers, the negotiation for August prices has started, and the target prices differed vastly from those in July. The murky market outlook put a dent in the multi-Si wafer ASP, which slid to US$1.053/piece, a 0.85% decrease. As for mono-Si wafers, ASP fell by 1.64% to US$1.442/piece due to the double impact from weakened demand and high-efficiency products. As for solar cell and modules, given the pessimistic European market outlook and clients’ emphasis on price-performance ratio, solar cell ASP dropped to US$0.455/Watt, a 0.66% decrease; module ASP dipped to US$0.743/Watt, a 0.13% decrease.

European solar companies jointly filed an anti-dumping complaint to the  EU against Chinese solar firms. In the meantime, the Chinese government is debating launching an anti-dumping investigation on multi-Si product imports from foreign companies. To top it all off, the United States’ final ruling on the anti-dumping and anti-countervailing cases will be decided in October, which ushers in uncertainty for the global solar market. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, solar demand for August has suffered a huge setback as prices and orders take a steep dive. Midstream and downstream solar firms have taken an extremely conservative stance on procurement with spot prices continuing to plummet.
EnegyTrend notes that the market outlook for August is extremely bleak, so much so that OEM orders are showing a pronounced downturn. Due to the sharp demand decline and the fact that the products from 2Q12 have yet to be completely digested, companies have started to adjust their product lines. On account of limited price cuts from suppliers, companies have been placing orders that just meet suppliers' minimum order quantity (MOQ) and relying on the spot market to supply their remaining demand, in an effort to cut costs. At present, spot prices continue to dip. Given that the market is sufficiently supplied, there is more room for spot price negotiations. As for high-efficiency Si wafers, contract price remained above US$1.13/piece, but a price of US$1.1/piece has appeared in the spot market. Moreover, payment conditions have become more flexible – suppliers have extended payment periods for clients with good credit in hopes of receiving more orders.
For this week, spot prices have dipped significantly due to stagnant August demand and the pressure imposed on manufacturers to adhere to supplier contract terms and implement price adjustments. For major manufacturers, polysilicon deals were conducted in the $20/kg range, whereas prices from second-tier manufacturers fell around $18/kg. Given the importance of product quality, in the event that prices amongst manufacturers do not differ significantly, products from the four major manufacturers will be favored. On the whole, polysilicon prices for the week have shown a continual decline, with the ASP falling to approximately $20.665/kg, a 0.82% decrease. For silicon wafers, significant price adjustments have been implemented given the negative market outlook and increasing demand for non-standard products. The weakened demand for high-efficiency items has caused the average multi-Si wafer price to slip to $1.04/piece, representing a 1.23% decrease. Mono-Si wafers fared no better, and saw average price drop by 1.32% to $1.423/piece. With regard to solar cells and modules, factors such as Europe’s bleak market outlook, increasing inventory levels, and trade investigation rumors have led to a decreasing price trend. Price for solar cells was $0.431/Watt, 5.27% lower than last week’s price. For modules, the lowest price was $0.5/Watt, whereas the average price has dropped to $0.741/Watt, a 0.27% decrease. Thin film products have dropped below the $0.7/Watt threshold to $0.698/Watt, a 1.97% decrease.

As European economic outlook remained stagnant, the industry hoped European Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Meeting held in early August could come up with a solution for the European debt crisis. However, ECB did not lower the interest rate as expected, nor did it announce any specific policy, which ushered in uncertainty for the European economy. Solar industry, by its very nature, relies heavily on the government subsidies. Therefore, the industry is severely affected by the sluggish outlook. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, certain investment projects in Europe have either been postponed or come to a halt due to a lack of fund.
Based on the statistics, growth momentum for European market in 1H12 was still there – the 1H12 solar installed capacity for Germany reached 4.3GW. Moreover, due to the climbing electricity price and declining solar system cost in Europe, certain areas of Germany and southern Europe have reached grid parity. Solar power prices in certain regions are reaching grid parity as the solar power generation cost continues to drop, which will trigger demand for replacement energies. However, under the current economic circumstances, the actual orders have yet to reflect the potential demand. Related manufacturers noted that although certain areas of Europe have achieved grid parity, the industry is still pessimistic about the 2H12 outlook for the European market due to the bleak economy and the fact that banks now hold more firmly to the funds. Related companies indicated that growth momentum for the European market may not pick up in the short run due to the current downturn, but once the economy begins to look up, Europe may see a sharp upswing on account of solar grid parity.

Manufacturers’ utilization rates have been on a decline as the market remains in a slump, which in turn affects their inclination to carry out the contracts with suppliers. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, recently cell makers’ utilization rates ranged between 50% and 70%, with some stronger companies’ utilization rates reaching 70%-80%. Due to the stagnant outlook, companies failing to acquire more orders chose to postpone carrying out their contracts. However, suppliers are starting to lose patience and put more pressure on their clients.
According to EnergyTrend, given the long-standing partnership between manufacturers and suppliers, in the past the latter seldom took it to the court when the market suffered from downturn; suppliers usually just managed to find the middle ground – despite the gap between the contract price and the spot price, both parties could still find a way to make the closing price closer to the spot price, allowing the manufacturers to cut down costs. However, the situation has started to change lately – on account of the bleak market outlook and weakened demand, orders from downstream companies has significantly decreased. In addition, with the prices continuing sliding and coming close to suppliers’ variable costs, suppliers can no longer afford to meet their clients’ price expectations in exchange of contract execution. Related companies noted they have received legal attest letters from their suppliers demanding the contracts to be executed. According to EnergyTrend, certain manufacturers were forced to forfeit their down payment. Whether or not suppliers will take legal action against their manufacturers remains to be seen.

According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, the demand in PV market remained sluggish. Outlook for September appears bleak, and the expected demand rebound may not occur. On the other hand, shrinking end-market subsidies has affected the return on investment (ROI) of solar systems. Manufacturers and makers have become less flexible when it comes to cost control and keeping ROI on a profitable level. Therefore, aside from the price adjustments of module, companies are now shifting their focus to cutting down the BOS (balance-of-system) price.
Given the fact that module prices have fallen to suppliers’ variable costs, prices will not see a further decline unless suppliers are willing to sell at a loss. As a result, suppliers started to urge BOS companies to accept higher prices. Furthermore, solar companies’ vertical integration has set foot into EPC and BOS sectors. Over the past few years major brand vendors have been striving to make inroads into the bidding project markets and have achieved certain level of success. Recently they have also invested in the mounting bracket market. According to EnergyTrend survey, due to intensifying competition, prices of solar inverter, mounting bracket and other EPC-related applications are starting to see fluctuations lately. Makers have provided more room for price negotiations in order to acquire market share. According to statistics, mounting bracket ASP dropped by 25%, while solar inverter ASP dipped 5%-10%.

According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, manufacturers are experiencing mediocre market condition where purchase orders plunge, which caused suppliers’ inventory levels to continue rising. Related manufacturers noted that the bleak market outlook results in the persisting price downtrend as the industry believes prices have not hit the rock bottom yet. During the recent price adjustments, EnergyTrend believes wafer makers suffered from the most prominent downturn – aside from the pressure from upstream and downstream players, the price competition among multi-Si wafer makers fueled the downtrend. EnergyTrend expects 2012 to be a difficult year for wafer makers as no signs of rebound is in sight.
According to the recent financial reports, wafer makers’ financial situations could not get any worse. GCL saw a loss of US$34.1 million in its solar business; ReneSola suffered from a US$75 million loss; Korean wafer maker Nexolon saw a loss US$60.08 million from 1H12; Taiwan’s Green Energy Technology saw a loss of US$58.8 million. First-tier companies from Taiwan, China, and Korea all underwent losses. Although manufacturers have been striving to lower manufacturing costs, the cost per wafer still ranges from US$1.05/piece to US$1.14/piece, with the spot price dropping to US$1.03/piece. As a result, manufacturers are selling at a loss. Looking towards 2H12, with no upswing in sight and the on-going solar trade wars amongst China, the United States, and Europe, 2H12 will see the slump persist and prices continue plunging.

According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce,  domestic PV demand in China seemed to be picking up. Research suggests that solar projects with capacity of above one MW are ongoing in northwestern cities in China, such as Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai. Moreover, Jiangsu and Liaoning announced their own subsidy policies, hoping to stimulate the solar demand along with the central government’s subsidy.
The European Commission has decided to conduct the anti-dumping investigation against Chinese module makers. Chinese manufacturers indicate that they have prepared for the worst, and the Chinese government will come up with solutions based on the verdict. According to EnergyTrend analyst Arthur Hsu, increasing domestic solar demand is the goal for both the Chinese government and manufacturers. For example, the installed solar capacity in Xinjiang is approximately 170MW. Judging from the bidding prices, the average price falls at $0.734/Watt, with the lowest price at $0.712/Watt. As for BOS (Balance of System), 20MW project’s average price is at $0.62/Watt, with lowest price at $0.507/Watt and lowest system cost at $1.218/Watt. Module’s bidding prices are 5%-10% lower than the spot prices, which will be appealing to Chinese manufacturers. Related manufacturers are confident about domestic demand’s growth momentum, but are concerned about how electric grid companies’ problems can delay the grid connection process. According to EnergyTrend, certain projects have had their systems installed, but yet to be connected to the grid due to unsolved technical problems.

It is most certain that 3Q12 will be a slow season for cylindrical battery, according to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce. Propelled by notebook sales for 2Q12, demand for related components including battery saw a surge. However, sales for 3Q12 fell short of expectations, and growth momentum for cylindrical battery have come to a halt. The capacity reduction took place in late 2011 was unable to deal with the weakened demand. As a result, cylindrical battery market is likely to remain oversupplied in 2012.
Duff Lu, Research Manager of TrendForce, notes that September and October were usually the peak shipping period to stock up for the coming Christmas holiday in the U.S. and Europe. However, considering the fact that most new products to be released in 4Q12 are equipped with polymer batteries, the stagnant notebook demand for 3Q12 put cylindrical battery market in a slump during July and August, and the situation is not getting any better in September.
As for polymer battery, according to EnergyTrend’s research, following the climbing tablet PC demand in June and July, polymer battery shipments saw a growth, but the growth momentum did not persist into August. Although some new products with high electricity consumption hit the market, their weak sales did not contribute to polymer battery shipment. Polymer battery price dipped in August as shipments decreased.Polymer battery market has been headed toward undersupply as notebook system battery capacity increases and end users’ preference for lighter products. For this reason, several battery makers have expanded their production in 2012.
On the other hand, since tablet PC’s demand for polymer battery is lower than that of notebook, the sufficient inventory left from earlier procurement weakened polymer battery demand in August. Polymer battery is usually custom-made – the more the orders, the lower the price. Therefore, even thought polymer battery has seen a modest price drop, the price may become less friendly if the demand keeps dropping, which will affect the manufacturers’ inclination to use it. TrendForce believes before low-priced square battery hit wide adoption, polymer battery needs to strike a balance between custom-made orders and standard orders in order to cater to end users’ preferences for lighter and cheaper products. As long as the system design concept remains unchanged, polymer battery will remain more of a niche market product with limited market share.

Due to the European Union’s announcement of starting an anti-dumping investigation on Chinese solar product imports, Taiwanese manufacturers have a shot at receiving more orders. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, several companies’ sales representatives have recently gone on business trips to Europe and the United States. Although Solar Power International 2012 is ongoing at the moment, it is evident that the business in Europe is to start picking up. Orders may start to pour in as the European market becomes more vital.
According to the information EU released, the initial ruling will be announced within nine months, with the final ruling following six months later. Related manufacturers predict that since EU might complete the investigation within three to six months, European companies, in fear of statute of limitations and the operation crisis that Chinese firms may face, will transfer the orders soon. According to EnergyTrend survey, Chinese companies have enacted measures to respond to any possible crisis, including cutting down labor costs and setting up production bases in different foreign locations to avoid the EU regulations. According to EnergyTrend, Southeastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and America are places where Chinese manufacturers may establish their new plant. Although Taiwan will not be amongst the Chinese companies’ preferential choices, with EU’s investigation and Chinese manufacturers’ possible production adjustments, Taiwanese firms may receive more orders from European companies in 4Q12 and 1Q12, which will largely increase their capacity utilization rates. However, the market outlook after 2Q13 will still depend on the initial ruling and Chinese manufacturers’ strategy.

Results of Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs’ 7th Solar Power Equipment Bidding have been announced on September 12, 2012. The installed capacity of bid winners amounted to 0.8MW. After the 7th bidding, there is no capacity left for another bid, though some manufacturers are hoping more capacity from the infrastructure sector will be released in 4Q12. However, according to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, the popularity of biddings in the infrastructure area remained high this year, so there will likely be no extra capacity provided in 4Q12.
According to information released, the average discount rate of the 7th bidding went up to 12.74%, a 169.34% increase compared to 6th’s 4.37%. Certain manufacturer’s discount rate has reached above 13%, showing some system integrators are willing to cut down profits in exchange for orders. Related companies noted that the most competitive bids were in the 100kW and 499kW sectors. Given the current feed-in tariff (FiT), manufacturers’ profit margin will take a serious hit. Moreover, the price setting process of 2013’s electricity price is about to start, and the sharp dip in the average discount rate may result in a drastic plummet in 2013’s solar feed-in tariffs. Related players stated that there has been different perspectives about the decrease of 2013’s solar FiT, and most people believe it is going to fall between 5% and 20%. Regardless of what the percentage decrease will be, FiT of both 100kW and 499kW will fall below NT$7/kWh. Related players pointed out that due to the fierce competition and manufacturers’ price cuts, the focus in 2013 may shift from 100kW-499kW sector to 30kW smaller-scale system sector.
Due to the gray area in the European Union’s anti-dumping investigation, Chinese solar manufacturers have seized the opportunity to digest their inventories. On the other hand, due to the absence of prominent rebound for demand, recently certain manufacturers have been disposing excess raw materials on the spot market – for instance, cell makers have been selling wafers, while wafer makers are attempting to cut down polysilicon inventory, which added more pressure to the spot prices and caused them to drop further.
Recently certain Chinese module makers have shut down their production lines. EnergyTrend notes that Chinese manufacturers’ utilization rates have been on a decline with idle capacity remaining high, suggesting that their downsizing effort, which will have limited impact on the worldwide PV market, was merely a solution to deal with the unused capacity.

The annual SPI (Solar Power International 2012) recently came to an end in Orlando. According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, compared to the previous years, SPI 2012 saw a decline in both attendees and popularity. Related manufacturers noted that during the three-day exhibition, there were some inactive booths; even though some companies from the west coast of the United States have paid for attendance fee, they had nothing but promotional materials seen at the exhibition. It shows that as the PV market outlook remains stagnant, solar companies’ budgets have become tight.
Moreover, the EU PVSEC that kicked off this week is not immune to the downtrend either. After interviewing several related companies, EnergyTrend found that few solar system procurements happened at the assorted solar exhibition this year. In the past, EU PVSEC was a major convention for Chinese and Taiwanese solar firms, and was where they would figure out the orders for the forth quarter and the coming year. However, they only sent sales representatives to the solar conventions this year; few procurement representatives were spotted. Related companies indicated that sales representatives were there to talk to clients about the market outlook and to see clients’ financial situation. Given the weak demand, solar companies remain conservative towards 4Q12. With the PV Taiwan exhibition starting in one week, Taiwanese and Chinese solar makers would use this opportunity for business interactions . Nonetheless, they stress that their main focus for 2H12 was on the Japanese market; with limited budget, investing in Japan will be their priority. Therefore, related manufacturers are more interested in attending PV Japan towards the end of the year.
According to EnergyTrend, the European Union has completed the initial investigation, and will analyze related information to determine whether or not it will start an anti-dumping and countervailing case against Chinese solar firms. In addition, with several annual major exhibitions about to commence, and with the coming up Chinese National Day holidays , sales on the spot market will remain in a slump.

Taiwan’s Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs held a hearing regarding the 2013 feed-in tariff (FIT) on October 1. According to the Bureau of Energy, the first period’s FIT in 2013 will fall between 9.23% and 12.63%, whereas the second period’s is between 1.9% and 5.62%. Related companies noted that FIT of solar roof system with capacity above 100kW and ground-mounted solar system fell below NT$7/kWh. Given the annual discount rate, loan rate, and feedback policy, this will be a threat to Taiwanese firms’ development in the PV sector.
According to EnergyTrend, the green energy research division of TrendForce, the solar system exists as a part of the power industry. Whether or not a project can be carried out depends on the amount of fund raised and the relation with other companies; factors such as power plant arrangement, establishment and operation come second. For most Taiwanese solar firms, few had experience in concrete planning and construction of 1MW (and above) projects. Moreover, under the influence of government policy, most companies opt to focus on 100kW and 500kW roof system, and only a few choose to invest in the ground-mounted system with longer investment return periods. Affected by the stagnant economic outlook and concerns over investment, Taiwanese manufacturers will have trouble raising enough funds if they do not have partners with good credit. According to EnergyTrend, despite strong interest from Taiwanese banks, restricted by relevant laws and limited global offices , most banks choose to cooperate with foreign firms in project development, and are unable to provide attractive financial incentives for local solar manufacturers and developers.

China Commerce Ministry has made the announcement number 70 and 71 on filing for anti-dumping and countervailing investigation against polysilicon from Europe, while carrying out investigations against imports of polysilicon from the U.S. and Korea at the same time. Polysilicon selling price would very likely be affected by the investigations, as Chinese first-tier manufacturers are currently leading the world market with their large production capacity covering wafer to module, and have comparatively more demand for polysilicon.
EnergyTrend , the green energy research division of TrendForce, has interviewed several first-tier vendors and conducted research on measures taken by the Chinese government to protect themselves against international trade war. EnergyTrend’s findings show that most manufacturers believe Chinese Polysilicon ASP will rally back up in 2013 not only because of the final determination of anti-dumping charges, but also the high penalty duties that will be imposed to add additional costs. Furthermore, second and third tier vendors who could not survive the economic recession have shut down factories one after another; those who successfully get through the downturn would be the few well-positioned suppliers to raise polysilicon prices, which EnergyTrend expects to show growth uptick in China next year.
Considering that Taiwan is another major PV supplying market with the largest production capacity after China, worldwide polysilicon suppliers would minimize their costs and risks by putting more attention on Taiwanese downstream manufacturers, who therefore stands a better chance of bargaining for lower material prices. EnergyTrend believes that the industry would gradually adopt the inverted pyramid business model in which upstream suppliers experience heavier competition when capacity oversupply issue sustains profit pressure. Under the current weak demand conditions, polysilicon prices, Taiwan’s especially, will deviate from China’s quotation and adjust towards downstream vendors’ expectations.
In regards to the spot market performances, given the recent wave of time-sensitive orders from the Chinese regions, capacity utilization rates from various manufacturers experienced a noticeable surge, with capacities being used to the fullest extent in some cases. As businesses within the industry indicate, these continuous orders can be helpful to manufacturers in terms of digesting excessive inventory and putting a halt to the pricing downtrend.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of global market research firm TrendForce, the PV markets in Middle Eastern regions are continuing to develop, with top oil producing countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia each showing relevant progresses in the area of planned investments. As EnergyTrend indicates, oil producing countries around the Persian Gulf are showing increasing ambition towards green energy projects, many of which tend to utilize capacities of up to various Giga watts.
Aside from the United Arab Emirate's MAZDAR City, Kuwait has been pushing for a similar development with its Silk City project. The project involves 2GW solar power installation, and places major emphasis on CSP, CPV, and PV technology, which accounts for approximately 30% of installed capacity. As observed by EnergyTrend, while the Middle East has a suitable environment for solar energy development, there are a number of geography-based challenges that serve as issues for future investors. Given the region's relative scarce water resources, the cost of the traditional cleaning method to maintain the module's power efficiency, for instance, is likely to give rise to soaring maintenance costs. On the other hand, as sandstorms tend to be relatively common in desert regions, whether businesses can successfully adapt to these regions becomes another potential issue to consider.
According to EnergyTrend, the Middle Eastern market tends to be preferable for European, the US, and Japanese businesses, but less so for those from China. Various Taiwanese manufacturers are already beginning to invest in the Middle East, and are seeking OEM and partnership opportunities as means to increase their visibility. Taiwanese manufacturers are expected to begin shipping relevant products to the Middle Eastern markets in 2013. Due to the barriers related to technological standards and regulations, manufacturers from China, many of whom rely on low pricing to gain a competitive strength, will have a difficult time entering the Middle Eastern markets.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, polysilicon and mono-Si wafer prices are continuing on an uptrend as talks regarding China's double anti-policy in February grow more widespread. With relevant institutions being largely optimistic about 2013's demand situation, various industry players are gaining additional confidence, which is in turn encouraging mid-to-downstream vendors to increase their price quotes. The bullish market outlook, should it persist, is likely to contribute to further price growth, in effect allowing the pricing uptrend to continue.
As indicated by EnergyTrend's data, the tax penalties imposed by the Chinese government on polysilicon importers are between 30 to 50%. For Chinese polysilicon vendors, such an increase is beneficial in that it not only paves way for higher profits, but also heightens the competitive advantages for relevant businesses within the Chinese industry. Affected by the polysilicon price surge, manufacturers for Si wafers, solar cells, modules, and peripheral components are beginning to keep a lookout for any potential price change. Given that the price surge, as perceived by relevant vendors, has only just begun, a price increase based on cost-considerations does not appear to be appropriate at the moment. Proper pricing adjustments are likely to take place only when the market situation calls for them.
As indicated by EnergyTrend, it is not unlikely for a pricing rebound to occur following a region-based shortage in the near future. In terms of the long run, given that the market oversupply will unlikely be resolved in a short period of time, system investors have generally been unwilling to see a decrease to their expected returns. In the periods to come, whether PV prices from the supply chain will be able to reach to and stay within break-even point will be a challenging issue for relevant PV businesses to consider.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, given the uncertainty surrounding the subsidy policies for the second quarter, along with the increasing demand coming from downstream clients, there is a good chance that the PV industry will perform beyond the expectations of a typical slack quarter during 1Q13.
As EnergyTrend's data indicates, in recent periods the number of industry orders has been on the rise. On the one hand, this has to do with the expected downward adjustments for PV subsidies during Japan's new fiscal year (beginning April 2013). In order to secure proper IRR, efforts to complete investments on grid-connected powers by the end of March have intensified, which in turn is helping to sustain Japan's PV market demand momentum. Given that China's double anti policy may not be officially implemented until Chinese New Year Holiday, Chinese vendors--in anticipating the European Union to carry out their policy at around a similar point in time--will attempt to prevent potential losses from arising during the look back period, and has been taking active steps to accelerate their shipments. The product orders for the Taiwanese PV vendors, as a result, are expected to continue to increase in the periods to come.
In addition to the changes experienced by the European and Japanese markets, the rise of China's domestic solar market, along with the growth experienced by the US market following increased subsidies for the green energy industry, are all contributing to the growing demand in the PV market. The recent subsidies intended for PV development in New York and Los Angeles, the emphasis on the use of renewable energy resources by US President Barrack Obama, and the large US power plant investments are also important factors that, according to relevant vendors, are continuing to reinforce PV market momentum. With the above factors taken into account, the prospects for the solar market in 2013, on the whole, remain largely optimistic.
With regards to the spot market, given the strengthened demand momentum and the reluctance on the part of the industry vendors to engage in transactions, polysilicon price quoted by Chinese businesses have continued to grow.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, solar cell and module manufacturers will be more active in improving product efficiency under the pressure of both installation costs and subsidy cut. As for new technologies, MWT technology has been generally appreciated by related industries; it is possible that the mass production stage takes place in 2013.
	Related industries indicated that the competition between Taiwanese manufacturers and Chinese manufacturers on solar cell production has been incessant. Currently the mainstream technology among the industry is mostly covered by Double Printing and Selective Emitter. The market has demanded, however, that the cost of power generation per watt be reduced, and the improvement in efficiency supported by the present mainstream technology may not be able to meet the needs of the market. Therefore, related industries have started to act more aggressively in the estimation and import of new technologies. They indicated that among many proposals, MWT technology stands out because it creates only a very low degree of interference in the existing manufacturing process, and changes in the production line would only include the increase of single station equipments. Moreover, both the enhanced efficiency of the effective area at the surface and the absolute conversion efficiency of the solar cell are incentives to the industries, and the package power loss of the module could also be further improved. In addition, the high cost of module package has declined in recent years, resulting in a decrease in the production cost per watt. Due to the advantages listed above, MWT technology has become the priority choice among manufacturers. According to the observations of EnergyTrend, some of the Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers have already entered the R&D and Pilot Run stage, and the mass production stage is forecasted to take place in the second half of 2013. However, the analysis of EnergyTrend also indicated that in order to carry out MWT technology, solar cell manufacturers must coordinate with module manufacturers; thus the MWT technology production time of Chinese manufacturers would be shorter than that of Taiwanese manufacturers. This would likely become a disadvantage for Taiwanese manufacturers.

The main products in the 2013 PV Expo exhibition are efficient power conversion products, and efficiency is also emphasized in peripheral products including materials, construction technology, manufacturing equipments, and other components. While subsidy continues to be revised downwards, the common goal among industries is to achieve grid parity--- in other words, to make solar power a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support. Efficiency improvement is no longer dependent on a single field, but instead the cooperation of the upstream and downstream of the industry chain; only when cost is optimized and efficiency is continually improved will the large potential PV market turn into practical business.
	On the other hand, industries in the exhibition also indicated that policy is still the key to improvements in the global PV industry. Though the ultimate goal of the industries is to completely extricate themselves from government subsidy, there is still a long way to go before achieving this goal and thus the stability of the policy could still greatly affect the global PV industry at the present stage. Related industries indicated that although the market has revealed reversion signals, the recent trade war effects are still unfavorable to the global market recovery; emerging markets will become the main driving force of market growth in the next few years, while earlier developed markets such as Europe, US, and Japan remain the basis of the global solar industry. If the Sino-US trade friction cannot be successfully solved, the long-term development of the global PV market may be crippled.
	Product popularity is still shown in the spot market after the Chinese New Year, and due to the delay in China’s double reverse policy, manufacturers indicated that there is still room for the price to rise before the policy is determined, a perspective in accordance with the market trend. Polysilicon price in the Chinese market has increased to $140.56RMB/kg; the average price of polysilicon wafers has increased to $6.15RMB/piece; the average price of single silicon wafers has maintained a price of $8.1RMB/piece; cell price has remained flat. In the US market, several Chinese manufacturers have currently decided to return to the industry, but downstream manufacturers indicated that first-tier manufacturers remain the major suppliers, and products other than those produced by first-tier manufacturers are mainly used as auxiliary material.

                                TrendForce:Market Differentiation Results in Price Increase of High Efficiency Products                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130308-4996.html,"

The PV Expo exhibition held in Tokyo, Japan ended last week and both the number of visitors and the performance of exhibitors have suggested a great future for the development of global PV market in 2013. However, according to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, market differentiation is gradually formed, and facing such change, industries are adopting more flexible strategies.
By interviewing related industries, we discovered that most industries at the exhibition believe that the Japanese market has its own uniqueness that differs from other markets. As shown at the exhibition, PID Free has become the common emphasis among various industries. According to related cell manufacturers, although PID Free was first proposed by European countries, it has been most greatly developed in the Japanese market. Certified industries such as TUV and PI-Berlin have frequently introduced themselves to related industries at the exhibition, hoping that their specifications could be first certified by the Japanese market. On the other hand, anti- snow load is also common among the industries at the exhibition; due to the recent extreme weather in northern Japan and Hokkaido, this has impressed the local customers even more. Therefore, common product specifications are more adopted by the Japanese market, and additional specifications in accordance with local market demands are also gradually increasing. Joint projects of related industries and Japanese local industries are increasing in order to be more suited for the market and more able to meet customer demands. By cooperating with each other, industries are therefore able to optimize limited resources and perform the best business strategies.
Benefiting from the increasing product popularity in the spot market, downstream manufacturers have started to raise the price. As for USD quotes, oversupply has resulted in prices lower than costs. Several polysilicon manufacturers have begun to cut production in order to reduce deficit; follow-up effects are yet to be seen.

Neo Solar Power Corporation (3576 TT) (“NSP”, or “the Company”), a leading producer of high quality solar cells in Hsinchu, Taiwan, announced its consolidated revenue on management account of NT$839 million for February 2013, which hits 6-month high and is representing an increase of 2.31% on month-over-month comparison.
Although February is with less working days and Chinese New Year holidays, the production line employees of the Company still worked overtime to respond to strong market demand and thus push the shipment and utilization rate. Besides, with the growing trend of cell ASP recently, it’s expected that the market is gradually recovering. This will also help the company to raise cell price, and then improve the margin.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, due to the increasing demands of high efficiency products, significant price advantage, and rumors suggesting that the double reverse policy is about to be finalized, Taiwanese solar manufacturers have continued to maintain a good order visibility and high capacity utilization rate. Unlike the past few months, manufacturers have recently become more positive towards the future, and order visibility has extended to the second quarter.
Though word is that subsidy is to be revised approximately 10% in the Japanese market, EnergyTrend and related manufacturers still believe that demands in the Japanese market will remain impressive due to the following reasons: even after a 10% subsidy revision, which is not a small cut, subsidies in the Japanese market still ranked first in the world; furthermore, subsidy for other renewable energies remained the same, which is beneficial to the promotion of renewable energy in the market. On the other hand, the EU double reverse is to be announced in the second quarter and in order to avoid the effects of the retroactive period, manufacturers must meet the Q2/Q3 market demands in advance, which resulted in an order visibility that has extended up to 3 months. In addition, though several manufacturers have gained less profit in February due to the holiday and product adjustments, they are positive about the future. The recent market condition, whether observed subjectively or objectively, is beneficial to Taiwanese solar industries. Still, manufacturers remain conservative about whether the market demands are able to be maintained after EU has announced their double reverse policy.
As for the spot market, sales are still booming and downstream manufacturers have confidently raised the price.

                                Manufacturers to Overcome Potential Obstacles as Investments in Australia Increase                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130325-5050.html,"

Numerous Taiwanese manufacturers have attended Australia’s solar investment seminar in order to understand the latest investment trends in the Australian PV market. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, though industries are highly interested in the overseas PV market, plans are still on paper due to the policy and environmental factors.
	Australia is a place with good natural conditions for the development of solar energy, and Northern Australia is among other areas the most suitable for PV development. However, since southeast and southwest are the main electricity consumption areas, electricity transmission and distribution becomes a huge obstacle to the development of renewable energy in Australia. In addition, related policies have also hindered the investment of overseas industries. It is said that Australia’s goal for renewable energy is 20GW/2020, which means that since they have already installed 11GW, until 2020, only 9GW is left for the market.
	Taiwanese manufacturers are reluctant to invest in this business due to the continually reduced subsidy and prolonged payback period. Related industries indicated that already common among Taiwanese industries, the downstream market expansion is the main reason for the fierce competition in the Taiwanese market. The main problems in the overseas market, however, are still financial issues involving local law, financial planning, international finance, and risk management. Huge capitals are involved in the overseas business, and funds are often taken up by only a few projects. Moreover, since Taiwanese manufacturers seldom expand business to the overseas market, they may feel powerless when bidding on projects, and the overseas market expansion may thus be delayed.
	Though price has continued to increase in the spot market, price increase in several products has slowed down.
	 As for USD quotes, polysilicon price has continued to rise. Silicon wafer manufacturers have reached maximum utilization, and high efficiency product price has continued to rise. Mono c-Si wafer price has also increased due to the high efficiency demands. Market demands for cells are still significant and may cause a continuous increase in cell price.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the utilization rate of Taiwanese cell and wafer manufacturers remained high, while average product price and revenue both significantly increased compared with 4Q12. Taiwanese manufacturers are positive towards the Q2 market performance—they believe that they will continue to benefit from the double reverse policy. Therefore, along with the growing market, silicon wafer price may increase in April.
Related manufacturers indicated that Taiwanese cell manufacturers have started to make price inquiries since last week, which means that demands are still significant in the market. According to EnergyTrend, the total shipment of Taiwanese cell manufacturers in Q1 is approximately 1.5GW, and since market demands are still significant, they increased labor in order to boost shipment up to 1.65GW in Q2. Taiwanese cell manufacturers must therefore confirm the price of raw materials as well as the cost of production in order to set product price in April.
As for the supply chain, related manufacturers have all sustained a high utilization rate and some even maintained full productivity after the Chinese New Year. GCL’s monthly shipment is approximately 100 million (30 million were shipped to Taiwan), GET’s monthly shipment is 30 million, LDK also shipped 30 million high efficiency M3 products this month, and Gigastorage, Utech Solar, and Eversol all maintained a high utilization rate.
The current market is centered on high efficiency products; related manufacturers indicated that the tight capacity has resulted in insufficient supply and the continually increasing spot price. Taiwanese silicon wafer manufacturers have thus been able to raise product price.

                                Responding to EU’s double reverse policy, Chinese PV manufacturers aggressively invest in the solar market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130408-5091.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, Chinese PV manufacturers are greatly interested in cooperating with Taiwanese manufacturers. Recently, first-tier manufacturers have come to Taiwan not only to exchange marketing ideas but also to resolve concerns and maintain their existing relationship with related industries.
PV manufacturers believe that it is possible for the double reverse policy to affect the market, but the level of taxes and policy coverage are the major concerns among the industries. EnergyTrend indicated that despite the slow market development, PV demands in the European market still accounted for approximately 30% of the global market. On the other hand, if the punitive tariff is less than 30%, Chinese products may still thrive in the European market by adjusting product price. Moreover, in the value added chain, the division of work is becoming more evident among Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers. In other words, as the penetration rate of Chinese manufacturers continues to increase, Taiwanese manufacturers will become more important in the global market.
Recent orders received by Taiwanese manufacturers are mostly from China and Japan; to several Taiwanese manufacturers, orders from China even accounted for approximately 50% of their overall production. Related industries indicated that their recent orders are overly dependent on Chinese manufacturers; if operational issues occur and Chinese manufacturers withdraw orders, the capacity of Taiwanese manufacturers would be greatly reduced. In other words, orders from China could enhance the capacity and interest rate of Taiwanese manufacturers, but business risk may also be greater.
Product regionalization is more evident in the spot market. In the Chinese market, polysilicon traded price has started to drop slightly due to the policy, cell price remained flat.As for USD quotes, polysilicon spot price has slightly increased up to 17.95USD/kg, showing a 0.2% increase; Multi c-Si wafer price was negotiated in April, this week’s average price stayed flat; Mono c-Si wafer price increased by 0.08% to 1.221USD/piece. On the other hand, cell price continued to increase in April due to sufficient orders, with this week’s average price at 0.389USD/Watt, a 0.78% increase. In addition, since subsidy has been adjusted downwards by 10% in the Japanese market, the number of orders may decrease in the future, thus this week’s module price remained flat.

                                The butterfly effect—EU’s ruling to stir solar development in the East Asia                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130412-5108.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the EU has entered the final stage of anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on China; though opinions differed among the European industries, it is highly possible that the two practices have taken place. Related industries indicated that since the solar industry in East Asia is still export-oriented, EU’s ruling will greatly affect the solar development in East Asia.
The EU has launched investigations from the wafer manufactures to the module ones, and the final ruling effects and tariff policy have become major concerns among the industry. If the EU imposes a punitive tariff on these products, there might be significant shifts in East Asia’s solar industry. According to EnergyTrend, in order to sustain their own interests, European EPC and PD manufacturers have opposed to the investigation. However, if punitive measures were put into practice, due to price, capacity, and quality, Korean module manufacturers may take advantage of the situation and set foot in the European market, becoming a strong rival to Chinese manufacturers. On the other hand, in order to spread risk, the Chinese industry has started to allocate capacity; in addition to contracts with local OEMs, due to cluster development, market potential, and transportation/production costs, Southeast Asia may become the future production base of Chinese manufacturers.
As for Taiwanese manufacturers, if EU’s investigation determines that there was sufficient evidence of dumping and subsidy, in the short term they may be able to benefit from the transferred orders and boost price and capacity. In the long term, however, things may be different. After China expands their overseas production capacity, their dependence on Taiwanese manufacturers may decrease; moreover, Korean and Southeast Asian manufacturers may also take advantage of this situation and expand their production, and the Taiwanese industry (mostly based on OEMs) may face considerable pressure. 
As for the spot market, product price in the Chinese market is still gradually declining. Polysilicon price was quoted between $130 RMB/kg-$140 RMB/kg. As for USD quotes, Multi c-Si wafer price has increased due to numerous orders; Mono c-Si wafer price stayed flat.

                                With power system development lagging behind, Chinese solar manufacturers will continue to face business difficulties                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130419-5128.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, US module company First Solar achieved the greatest profit among other global module companies in 2012, showing an annual gross profit of 852 million USD. Chinese company Yingli Solar, on the other hand, faced a gross loss of 59.2 million USD. First Solar and Yingli Solar, however, both faced a net loss . (96.338 million USD and 512 million USD, respectively).
In the recent annual conference, First Solar showed optimism towards the 2013 solar development. Over the years, they have continued to reduce cost as well as improve their visibility in emerging markets; it is known that First Solar has not only launched business in North America, but also allocated resources in emerging markets such as India, Chile, the Middle East, and China. Starting from 2012, they also aggressively invested in power systems and developed areas including project development, EPC, and O&M, and this business transformation has brought considerable feedback. In 2013, First Solar plans to produce 1.4GW power systems (80%-90% of their total capacity), and in 2014, they tend to reach 1.5GW-1.6GW and reduce the impact of the market price by maintaining a high utilization rate.
On the other hand, Chinese first-tier manufacturers that still focused on module production were affected by the rapid price decline in 2H2012 and failed to gain considerable profit. In addition, due to the smaller investment scale of self-developed projects, in the case of high utilization rate, module prices are more vulnerable to market fluctuations. Therefore, compared with First Solar, they are more likely to face the loss of profit. Yingli, for example, has faced profit loss throughout the whole year of 2012. In order to improve their business, Chinese manufacturers have begun to increase project developments and the investment in engineering turnkey projects; major manufacturers such as Yingli, Trina, and ReneSola, for example, have started to invest in the Chinese and global market in order to acquire a larger market share. 
As for the spot market, slow price decline still occurred in the Chinese polysilicon market. As for USD quotes, affected by the decreased demands, polysilicon spot price has continued to fall. On the other hand, cell manufacturers have continued to receive numerous orders; this week’s average price consistently increased.

In May, Germany will implement the new subsidy plan that supports commercial and residential solar storage systems, and Japan has already announced that they are going to build the world’s largest solar storage system. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, in order to maintain renewable energy and enhance its reliability, the combination of power generation and energy storage is inevitable and will become the development trend in the future PV industry.
According to EnergyTrend, solar energy storage systems are not completely popularized at the present due to considerations regarding the additional cost as well as the optimum capacity of the energy storage systems. Medium/small sized solar storage systems (used in houses or offices) are usually based on ternary cells, and the cost of these cells may not drop in the short term. EnergyTrend estimated that the additional cost of energy storage systems could be 2 times greater than that of power generation systems; this excessive cost was one of the main reasons why such systems could not be popularized. In addition, the standard for the optimum capacity of energy storage systems has yet to be determined, which also influences customers’ intention to install such systems. 
However, with solar energy storage systems, the power supply and stability of the solar generator could be significantly enhanced. Germany plans to issue a subsidy of 25 million Euros to residential and commercial solar energy storage systems that are installed after 5/1/2013. According to EnergyTrend, the subsidy plan was originally up to 60 million Euros, but the final version was reduced by over 50%. This may cause a delay in the promotion of solar energy storage systems.
As for the spot market, price still declined slowly in the Chinese market.  Multi c-Si wafer and mono c-Si wafer price both stayed flat due to Europe’s approaching anti-dumping and countervailing policy (though manufacturers have already started to negotiate the price for orders in May, they have adopted a conservative attitude); cell and module price also stayed flat due to the concerns about the decreased market demands that may occur in May. As for USD quotes, Cell and module manufacturers are still observing the market development, and the price of both cells and modules remained flat.

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, as thin digital devices continue to lead the trend, cylindrical and polymer cells may bring the once promising large-capacity cells back into the market. It is expected that starting from 2013, the average size of cell modules will be significantly reduced; the volume of large capacity cylindrical cells, for example, has been reduced by 34%, and cell price has dropped in two consecutive quarters. In addition, due to its large capacity, polymer cell price has dropped rapidly. Small-capacity cells are therefore being less applied in the market, and polymer cells have acquired a larger market share than cylindrical cells.
                                                                                   Cell Price Change

Source：EnergyTrend
Large-capacity cell price continues to fall due to increased production
According to EnergyTrend, thin laptops have initiated the thin component trend. In 1Q13, the traditional off-season, polymer cell price has increased due to the lack of supply; during this period of time, both large-capacity (>3.5Ah) and small-capacity (<3.5Ah) cells have maintained a high price. Although large-capacity polymer cells are still in the initial stages of amortization, compared with small-capacity cells, large-capacity cells will still have more room for price increase due to its higher efficiency. Large-capacity cell price will start to decline in 2Q13 because these cells will then be more widely applied to tablets.
As for cylindrical cell price, small-capacity cell unit price has dropped lower than cost and manufacturers could no longer afford to acquire market shares by reducing product price. It is expected that price will remain flat in Q2. As for Large-capacity cells, most of the production line has amortized, so the average price is very competitive; it is expected that the use of large-capacity cells (such as 2.8Ah and 3.0Ah) will continue to increase and accelerate the price decline of large-capacity cells.
Penetration rate of large-capacity cylindrical cells continues to rise
Although cells used in laptops may be different, the market has continued to follow the specifications and launching time of Apple’s various products. The trend of larger cell capacity in 2013 not only accelerates price decline but also suggests that thin systems are causing shifts in the cell industry.
TrendForce forecasted that before 2014, polymer cell and cylindrical cell demands from laptops and tablets will form a golden cross –polymer cell demands will reach 59M/m, which is greater than cylindrical demands (55M/m). Though the overall demand for cylindrical cells is continually decreasing, these cells can still be divided according to their capacity. In addition, while the application of large-capacity cells increases, the unit price also declines. 2.2Ah cells currently accounts for less than 50% of the laptop cell market (and may continue to decrease); the penetration rate of 3.0Ah and 3.2Ah cells, on the other hand, will continue to grow by 10% each quarter.

                                Oversupply and M&A occur in the PV inverter market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130506-5182.html,"

Having in mind that solar power may become the next major energy source, global electricity and automation technology manufacturer ABB announced that they will acquire Power One, a large PV inverter manufacturer. The purchase price is expected to be over 1 billion USD, and both ABB and Power One hopes to complete the M&A by the end of 2013. Oversupply and high cost still remained main challenges of PV industries, and the merger of the two large companies may bring the market to a different phase.
According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, Power One is currently the second largest inverter supplier in the global market, and ABB is not only a major company in the global electricity market, but also one of the top ten global PV inverter suppliers. After the M&A of the two companies, competition with the leading PV inverter manufacturer SMA may become more intense, and inverter price may also decline.
On the other hand, market share considerations also may have caused the M&A of the two companies. First-tier PV manufacturers have started to shift their business to emerging markets, and while they boosted demands, they also faced increased investment risk and financial pressure as well as the unstable electricity environment. ABB is deeply rooted in the global electricity market, and Power One covers products ranging from small residential systems to large solar power plants. The cooperation of the two companies may accelerate the development in emerging markets and increase their market share.
In addition, since the global PV on-grid installation has increased, PV systems have more often overlapped with traditional power systems, thus how to maintain a stable on-grid power output and increase the use of renewable energy has become the main focus among related industries. It becomes clear that manufacturers that are able to set foot in both fields and provide comprehensive solutions will be the most advantaged.
As for the spot market, price still slowly declined in the Chinese market; silicon wafer price declined (due to the Labor Day holiday and the strong hesitation in the market) while cell and module price stayed flat. As for USD quotes, due to the reduced demands, polysilicon price continued to drop. On the other hand, Mono c-Si wafer manufacturers started to reduce price due to the decreased demands in May, thus this week’s Mono c-Si and Multi c-Si wafer price both declined. Module price increased due to the price increase of several non-Chinese made.

                                Europe imposes heavy tariff on China’s PV products, manufacturers caught in the solar industry shuffle                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130512-5212.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of Trendforce, Europe’s anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on China suggested that the government has subsidized their domestic solar manufacturers, and Europe may impose a punitive tariff (more than 30%) on China’s PV products. In addition, the wide range of products that may be affected by the punitive tariff suggests that organizations (EU ProSun and AFASE) are still defending their own interests.
EnergyTrend indicated that the US has already determined Chinese PV manufacturers’ unfair competition in the market. SolarWorld, the leader of Europe’s litigation, has also initiated legal proceedings against China in the US. EnergyTrend believes that if Europe’s final ruling differs significantly from that of the US’s, they may face considerable pressure. On the other hand, as long as the grounds of US’s ruling remains the same, Europe’s charges against China’s illegal subsidies will not be questioned.
The current tax rate ranges from 30%-60%. According to EnergyTrend, the current Chinese module price quoted in the European market is between €0.52/Wp-€0.58/Wp, and based on this price, Europe’s system project’s ROI (Return on Investment) will be approximately 8%. Once module price increases by over 30% and Germany cuts subsidy by 1.8% in May, the system’s IRR will decrease by at least 1%, which is unfavorable to the following investments in the industry.
	Tax rates are discussed in the market, but the range of the punitive tariff is yet to be determined. According to EnergyTrend, whether Chinese panel products should be included is debated by European PV manufacturers and the downstream companies. In the European solar industry, though PV manufacturers have continued to face deficit and the fear of bankruptcy, EPC companies and Project Developers (PD) still gained profit due to the low cost Chinese modules. Once module price increases, EPC companies may face significant profit loss if investors wish to maintain their overall revenue and investment projects may also be postponed.
In order to maintain their own interests, European EPC and PD manufacturers have opposed to such investigations. If the anti-dumping and countervailing investigation is put into practice, considering the production cost and recovery time, we believe that Chinese manufacturers will accelerate their module production transfer. They may sign OEM contracts with local manufacturers, and considering the market potential and well as transportation and production cost, Southeast Asia may benefit the most and become China’s largest overseas production base.In addition, Europe’s ruling may also bring business opportunities to Taiwan. With the transferred orders, Taiwanese manufacturers may then be able to maintain considerable capacity and product price.
As for the spot market, due to the negative rumors in the market and the low contract and spot price, manufacturers are reluctant to invest in the Chinese market. As a result, polysilicon, Mono c-Si wafer, and Multi c-Si wafer price all stayed flat. As for USD quotes, affected by decreasing demands, polysilicon spot price has continued to fall. Rumors in the market has also shaken wafer manufacturers, thus this week’s Mono c- Si wafer and Multi c-Si wafer price both showed a slight decrease. On the other hand, Taiwanese cell manufacturers have maintained a stable price increase, and cell/module demands are expected to increase in Q2.

Apart from the rumor which says that China’s going to impose anti-dumping tariffs on the imported polysilicon, the Chinese government continues to communicate with Europe’s major member countries through diplomatic ways, hoping the member countries can encourage Europe to adopt a more moderate standpoint. The German government officials have spoken in succession lately indicating their disagreement with any regulations that may raise the possibility of a trade war. This made the market believe there might be a change to the double reverse policy (anti-dumping and countervailing). With the situation constantly changing, the double reverse policy is likely to lead to three possible scenarios, according to EnergyTrend, a green energy research division of TrendForce: 1) As originally intended, Chinese manufactures still have to pay high punitive tariffs. 2) The case is overturned. The punishment towards Chinese manufacturers will be toned down or cancelled. 3) A compromise is reached. The alternative solutions so far include the possible control on total capacity and the limitation on the lowest sales price.
According to EnergyTrend, the initial conclusion of the case will not have to be agreed on by the member countries. The final ruling, however, will have to be approved by them. The critical focus for now is whether the final result in December will be in China’s favor or not. And which one of the three scenarios above will be adopted? The result will depend on the negotiations among the European Investigation Council, the European member countries, and China. We believe that the possibility for cancelling the punishment won’t be high in the initial stage in June. Based on this, EnergyTrend believes there won’t be major problems with the purchase orders for Q2/Q3. The market will be ready to enter into the off-peak season in Q4, which is also when the final announcement is set to take place. The status and effects of the double reverse case can be further observed through Europe’s solar energy exhibition in October. This will allow us to better evaluate the impact on next year’s purchase orders.
On the other side, the range of products affected by Europe’s anti-dumping tariff includes not only the modules but also the Chinese PV cells that are exported to Europe. Assuming the anti-dumping tariff is put into practice (as scenario 1 suggests), we believe Chinese PV manufactures may come up with the following three strategies:
Strategy 1 : Direct export of China’s module production to Europe
	Based on the supply and demand price model shown on EnergyTrend, if Europe imposes anti-dumping tariffs on the PV cells and modules, and if China announces countervailing measures on imported polysilicon as well as adopts different tax rates per region, the price of polysilicon in the Chinese market may increase to 19.5~24.5USD/kg. If Chinese manufacturers choose to assemble and model the PV cells in China and then sell them to Europe, then once the module taxes are levied, the cost will be at least 0.741USD/W, which is 30% higher than that of the current products exported to Europe. The price is almost comparable to the lowest price of other brands (from Europe, US, Japan) sold in Europe. EnergyTrend believes Chinese manufacturers won’t adopt this strategy given the lack of a brand premium and advantage on cost.
Strategy 2: China’s PV cells will be exported to Europe or other regions to be assembled into modules 
	The processing cost is around 0.13~0.16USD/W for China’s top PV cell factories. The lowest cost per PV cell is above 0.399USD/W, considering the tax rate that might be imposed as the silicon wafers and PV cells are exported to Europe. If using the local module factories in Europe, the cost will be around 0.28USD/W~ 0.34USD/W, considering the mainstream cost structure in the current market and the possible tax rate margin. It is forecasted that once the module production of China’s PV cells is completed in Europe, the cost will be around 0.75USD~0.83USD/W.
Strategy 3: Have a third party country produce PV cells in Europe or export PV modules to that region
	When a PV cell made in a third party country is assembled into a module in a non-China factory, the lowest cost it can get is 0.666USD/W. But as the demand increases, the price of the PV cells made in the third party country may also increase. In addition, the price of Europe’s end module may rise by more than 10~15%. When such a business model is adopted, the strategies of the Chinese factories operating in Europe will no longer be about clearing out gigantic PV cells and module capacity, but rather about strengthening their brand visibility in the European market. This is similar to how Western countries (Europe, USA) and Japan promote their products through their own brand image, and how they leave manufacturing tasks to regions that are not affected by tariffs.
EnergyTrend indicates that while products in China are confronted with high tax rates, the market demand for Taiwan’s PV cells and modules has increased rapidly. Compared with the related China-produced solar products that are exported to Europe, Taiwan’s solar products hold a notable advantage on cost. In the second quarter, Taiwan’s PV cell business might turn profitable under the international trade wars. As for this week’s spot price, there could be changes because Europe’s member countries will hold a discussion regarding the double reverse policy on 25th of May. As the atmosphere in the market becomes tense, purchasing momentum is likely to shrink. Some of the manufacturers indicate that inventory will be controlled carefully in the short run due to the unpredictable market news and the upcoming semi-annual reports. Big moves, however, are unlikely to take place until the results of the double reverse case becomes clear. Therefore, the spot price for this week is about the same as that of last week. Regarding thin-film, due to the increasing demand and the price comparison effect, the price for this week has slightly increased.

                                Chinese PV manufacturers to shift production -–a certain trend in the market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130607-5290.html,"

The European commission plans to make peace with the Chinese government by reducing the punitive tariff to 11.8% for 2 months starting on June 6. They tend to reach a consensus with the Chinese government on the dumping incident through diplomatic negotiation, but if Chinese PV manufacturers still fail to abide by the stipulations by August 8, the European commission will once again impose the original tax rate (which will be an increase from 37.2%-67.9%). In other words, these two months will be a break for Chinese PV industries to re-create their business plans.
According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the 11.8% punitive tariff in the first stage was an acceptable amount to the manufacturers, and it only had a small effect on product price. EnergyTrend discovered that the current average price of related products shipped to Europe is $0.5€/Watt, and calculated by the current exchange rate and tax rate, the average price of products shipped to Europe in June will be $0.559€/Watt (approximately $0.732USD/Watt). Compared with other non-China made products, such products still have a price advantage. In addition, Taiwanese manufacturers have determined the price in June, and even though Europe’s policy has changed, manufacturers still believed that price will not be affected.
Moreover, Chinese manufacturers have started to shift production in order to reduce business risk. EnergyTrend indicated that Chinese module manufacturers have already planned to shift their production in order to avoid the anti-dumping and countervailing punitive tariff, and the business transfer is now becoming more intense. Yingli, for example, may start producing related products in the US or Europe, ReneSola has already outsourced their production to Europe, and CSUN has started to produce cells and modules by cooperating with other manufacturers in Turkey. 
As for the spot market, the more vivid market trend, China’s possible anti-dumping and countervailing subsidy on polysilicon, and the price change made by several manufacturers have caused a slight price change in the market. Silicon wafers were still in short supply but customer demands were still high, suggesting a great opportunity for manufacturers to raise price; however, product price has already reached the acceptable limit of customers, thus price only increased slightly. Cells were still in short supply because regardless of Europe’s policy change, customers did not cancel their orders. In addition, cell price in June was also defined. Moreover, due to the significant demands during the peak period as well as effects brought by the policy, module price still steadily increased.

                                EU AD Tariff has Both Pros and Cons. Industry Traders Wait and Watch the Developments                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130617-5308.html,"

The European Union during June and July will decrease the anti-dumping tariff from 47% to 11.8%. The impact this could have on production is still being assessed. As stated by global market intelligence organization TrendForce’s research division EnergyTrend, their focuses is on the change in placement orders that could occur in the next two months due to the lowered tariff rate being in an acceptable range for Chinese industries.
According to EnergyTrend, with it still being unclear as to whether Europe and China can come to an agreement within two months, China has continued to increase production capacity, taking advantage of this time period to speed up its deliveries to the European market. We expect to see a mini-boom during the months of June and July. Previously, to avoid taxation from Europe, Chinese manufactures turned to Taiwan companies for orders. Whether or not the order status will change during this temporary period of lowered taxation is the focus of EnergyTrend’s observations. Due to Taiwan and China’s quoted price having a difference of 5%~10%, Chinese manufacturers are beginning to consider adjusting the order proportions. The future developments are worth paying attention to.
In accordance to the impact on the PV industry in Taiwan, EnergyTrend’s investigation shows that industries maintain a positive outlook for the future. Related industries expressed that current orders can already be seen for the Q3. The majority of sales for June have already been completed, with some industries already being 70~80% complete for July sales. However June still has customers placing orders. Cell production capacity supply and demand situation remains critical and are not concerned with consumer order adjustment. The decision on whether to pass the anti-dumping tariff and anti-subsidy for the European market will be clearer during August. Related industries will not risk placing orders for fear of high losses in case the situation does not develop as planned in August. They believe that even though the market is making a lot of noise lately, both sides are still trying to feel each other out, with the possibility of it actually happening being low.
For the entire spot market, due to consecutive days off for Dragon Boat holidays and market information becoming clearer, there was not much price fluctuation this week. As for polysilicon, due to the possible double reverse policy, China polysilicon prices rose slightly, but Taiwan prices dropped causing the average price to waver slightly. For silicon wafers, prices for multi c-si  maintained an even price, while mono c-Si experienced a slight decrease. Even though traders hoped that cell and module price would continue to rise, however the quote price has already reached an acceptable limit for consumers. Adding on the impact of the holidays, spot market business lightened, causing prices for this week to remain even.

                                For Solar Energy Average Conversion Efficiency, Government Policy Should Remain the Focal Point for the Future                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130624-5332.html,"


	InterSolar Europe 2013 officially started this month on the 17th. Although market issues related to the anti-dumping and countervailing policy has been temporarily put to an end,, the discussion focus among the business world during this year’s exhibition will still be on the direction of government policies and products. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce,, even though the exhibition officially started on the 17th, some companies had already begun throwing around some topics for discussion in order to observe market reaction.

	 

	Another hot topic for this year’s expo is the direction that government policies will take after the beginning of August this year. According to EnergyTrend’s understanding, Europe’s main systematic companies like Project Developer and EPC as well as other related companies, continue to firmly oppose the anti-dumping tariff being purposed by the EU. Related companies indicated that due to the decreased amount in subsidies, ROI are no longer as good as they once were. On top of that, future module prices continue to rise due to the influence of the anti-dumping investigation, which has affected company’s willingness to invest. If the conflict is not able to be resolved, companies like Solarstrom and Juwi have a grim outlook for future development in the European market. On the other hand, EnergyTrend’s observations state that non made-in-China modules have become the key point for most of the manufacturers in this year’s exhibition. Companies like Suntech Power, China Sunergy (CSUN), and BenQ Solar during the expo all came up with non made-in-China products. Some companies hope to increase market share for products in the European market, using propaganda to strengthen the characteristics of European production.

	 

	Aside from government policy, companies still focus on pursuing product efficiency. Besides traditional Si-Base products, TSMC Solar and Solar Frontier also revealed the top module products with a conversion efficiency surpassed 14%, showing their strong ambition. According to current data, products that surpass 14% have the hope to compete head to head with traditional products for cost. That being said, EnergyTrend is more concerned with what the current average conversion efficiency and capacity utilization rate are. When will the entire average efficiency be able to surpass 14%? These questions are of great concern for the future competitiveness for products, as well as the future development for companies. Aside from all this, due to Germany passing the subsidy bill for energy storage products,some companies have came up with corresponding solutions to comebine energy generation and energy storage, and the total solution will become one of the focus during this year’s expo.

	 

	From the perspective of the entire spot market, the future direction looks bright with orders being high. Although the EU has given Chinese products a grace period of two months to increase shipments, it has in turn caused a critical situation for some production capacity. However, this has not caused there to be a demand exceeds supply scenario so price direction has not had any obvious changes. Spot market prices remain stable. For poly silicon price, since the price has had a slight drop in the Chinese market, this has lead to this week’s market price maintaining a slight tremor pattern. Cells showed a change in price for some companies.

                                With grace period for the anti-dumping and countervailing policy approaching, Chinese manufacturers accelerate shipment to alleviate inventory pressure                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130629-5358.html,"

The grace period for the anti-dumping and countervailing policy which Europe offered is half way through. Currently, different interest groups in the market have come up with different sayings. Although the compromise among Europe, China, and the committee hasn’t been reached yet, the overall market trend is transforming quietly. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, Chinese manufacturers have been rushing to get the shipment out in the past two months. In addition, another focus is on Chinese manufacturers’ inventory clearance condition.
Judging from EnergyTrend’s investigation, although made-in-China products that are exported to Europe will be imposed an anti-dumping tariff of 11.8%, other manufacturers indicate that inventory pressure has reduced and companies’ financial condition has improved due to the recent increasing market price and the increasing cash flow caused by inventory clearance. Hence, as long as the price difference is within $0.02USD/Watt between the total cost and the cost on the product produced by a third-party country, Chinese manufacturers will be able to prioritize their own products.
On the other hand, while Chinese manufacturers choose to prioritize their own products, there shouldn’t be any significant changes toward Taiwanese manufacturers’ orders. EnergyTrend believes that policy interference is not over yet. Chinese manufacturers will still need the assistance from Taiwanese manufacturers in the short run, thus it’s not likely for Chinese manufacturers to break the partnership easily until the result is finalized. 
Besides, regarding the direction on the European policy after August, based on the discussion result between EnergyTrend and the manufacturers, most of the manufacturers believe that Europe is most likely to adopt price increase or quantitative import restrictions  towards made-in-China products that are exported to Europe. Yet, EnergyTrend has already considered fixed quantity pricing policy as the possible final solution many weeks ago. It’s mainly because fixed quantity pricing can help revive Europe’s PV industry that’s almost left behind in certain ways; meanwhile, it won’t sabotage the profit margin between the current mainstream system investment and system installers.
From the perspective of the overall spot market, the recent market trend remained unstable with this week’s overall trend going slightly downward. In terms of PV products, due to the extremely small difference between the contract and spot prices, the supplies used are mainly from materials purchased through contracts. In addition, because of the decreased price on the polysilicon imported by China, the polysilicon spot market price slightly declined this week. For polysilicon wafer, most of the Chinese manufacturers lowered the price for specific clients. For monosilicon wafer, the price decrease in China has affected the average price trend. Lastly, the module price remained the same.

The grace period for the anti-dumping and countervailing policy is almost coming to an end. Although it’s not certain whether the compromise can be reached between China and Europe, the recent spot market momentum is yet to be observed. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the point where the spot market price raised began last December. However, the raise has slowed down and part of the product price even dropped. To look into the future development, EnergyTrend believes that the future price will have to depend on the policy direction in August. If fixed quantity pricing is going to be adopted in the end, there will be limitation for the future product price to increase. Moreover, it may completely reverse the entire situation.
EnergyTrend indicates that the average polysilicon spot price has started to go downward after reaching its peak after this March. Based on the statistics, polysilicon price has entirely increased from December to March, but the increasing range has differed by region. Impacted by the anti-dumping and countervailing issues, Chinese manufacturers rushed to get the shipment out which in turn drove strong demand towards polysilicon, maintaining a 3.5%-4.5% rise each month. In terms of other regions, the market reacted slower, maintaining a 4% rise only in February and March. The price decline accelerated since April with a 1.2%-1.3% decline in average and a 5%-6% decline in average in May.
In terms of silicon wafer, the product price remained upward until April but it’s moving toward a different development direction in May. For monosilicon wafer, there was a 0.2%-1.5% drop in average in May mainly because monosilicon demand and high-efficiency polysilicon demand’s negatively correlated. Judging from EnergyTrend’s observation, the demand for high-efficiency products in May has shifted from monosilicon to polysilicon hence caused monosilicon wafer demand to move slower and price to go down. For polysilicon wafer, the market price remained upward from December to May. Yet, it started to go downward since April. According to EnergyTrend, there’s a slight gap between the market price for high-efficiency products and normal grade products. While the price of high-efficiency products remained upward, the price of normal grade products showed a downward trend. Thus, the price of normal grade products is likely to affect future product price. 
Regarding the downstream cell and module, product price remained upward until the end of May. For cell, a 2% and above rise has been maintained since February. Although it slightly decreased in April, it rose again in May. Except the market momentum’s good for Taiwanese manufacturers to keep the negotiation advantages, with the demand entering into peak season, it will also boost the price. In terms of modules, although the price’s going upward, a 1%-3% rise could be rather slow compared with other products. According to EnergyTrend, because system operators tend to focus on maintaining investment ROI, they particularly resisted to revise the price downward. As module manufacturers looking after both shipment and cost, price can only be revised slightly upward.
Judging from the spot market overall performance, manufacturers’ trading condition for the current spot market has declined due to the contract execution. In addition, China’s polysilicon price has continued to decrease. This week’s polysilicon spot market price has slightly declined. For polysilicon wafer, the price of normal grade products declined while that of high-efficiency products remained the same. Moreover, because the recent demand for some manufacturers focus on normal grade products. For monosilicon wafer, China’s quoted price continued to decline. By observing the European Committee’s policy direction in August and the future development on China’s domestic policy, the manufacturers’ attitudes have turned conservative. While the heat for market trade started to cool off, this week’s cell and module price remained steady.

                                Hoku announces bankruptcy; the future for small polysilicon factories seems gloomy                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130715-5411.html,"

The US PV raw material supplier, Hoku, announced its bankruptcy on July 4th. The bankruptcy also affected its subsidiary company, Hoku Materials, which produced polysilicon. According to the most recent global PV industry database collected by global market intelligence organization TrendForce’s research division EnergyTrend, it showed the limited growth for the market demand and the continuously decreasing polysilicon price. The overall condition for polysilicon industry in the future can still be bumpy and the future for small polysilicon factories remains gloomy.
EnergyTrend indicated that the global polysilicon capacity was around 390 thousand tons by 2Q13, with the capacity from top five manufacturers accounting for 57.6% and that from top ten manufacturers accounting for 71.6%. Besides, based on EnergyTrend’s data, the amount of shipment in the first half year of 2013 turned out to be about 80 thousand tons with the market share from top five manufacturers representing more than 70% and that from top ten manufacturers representing more than 80%. It clearly showed that global polysilicon manufacturers ranked after tenth place will face tough challenges in terms of either capacity or output.

Concerning polysilicon cost and price, because most of the new polysilicon manufacturers started to build factories since 2007, the following cost should be applied to the new factories built after 2007 based on EnergyTrend’s data. Depending on the scale of production in each factory, the depreciation cost was between $6/kg-$12/kg. The energy cost was $8/kg-$14/kg and the total cost was between $24/kg-$28/kg. There’s a 10%-20% cost spread compared to major manufacturers. On the other hand, polysilicon price significantly declined since 2010. The recent spot price even wandered around $16/kg-$18/kg, which also impacted the price that tied down to the contract. According to the data, the recent contract price has dropped to $20/kg. Regarding cost and price, the best major manufacturers can do was to break even or stay loss, which put more burdens on small polysilicon manufacturers with less financial ability. EnergyTrend believed that Hoku’s bankruptcy is just the beginning. If polysilicon price doesn’t increase significantly in the short run, more manufacturers will face the bankrupt pressure.
Judging from the spot market overall performance, because the demand’s turning slow and that China may not execute anti-dumping and countervailing policy on polysilicon according to first-tier manufacturers, this week’s polysilicon spot market price continued to decline. For Multi-Si wafer, the gap between the price for high-efficiency products and normal grade products remained. With recent demand and price being stagnated, this week’s price was unchanged. For cell, due to the decreasing demand, the quoted price for normal grade products continued to decline. In addition, the price for high-efficiency products have started to loosen and caused the average price to go down. For module, the due date for modules shipping to Europe has passed and future demand will have to depend on the policy result by August. Moreover, Japanese market is likely to gain more certifications, which will affect the amount of shipment in the future.

                                The shipment for Chinese PV products account for 60% in the 1H13, future of European module manufacturing industry becomes unpredictable                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130720-5430.html,"

Several PV manufacturers in Europe have either declared bankruptcy or are seeking to reorganize. For example, Solarezo, Conergy, and Gehrlicher all filed for insolvency and some manufacturers have started business restructuring. While Scheuten Solar has been looking for buyers to take over its German module plant, Panasonic has planned to close its module plant in Hungary in September. According to the most recent global PV industry data collected by global market intelligence organization TrendForce’s research division EnergyTrend, the future for PV manufacturering in Europe is worrisome due to the government subsidy reduction, high manufacturing cost, and competition from cheap Chinese products.
As indicated by global PV industry data, total module capacity in the world was around 54GW by 2Q13. Chinese manufacturers’ total capacity accounted for about 60% of the worldwide capacity. Among the top ten manufacturers, only FirstSolar was not a Chinese manufacturer. The situation seemed to be the same for the shipments. The total amount of shipment in the world reached 15GW in the first half of 2013 while Chinese manufacturers’ total shipment quantity accounted for more than 60% in the worldwide shipment quantity. It’s clear that Chinese products have taken the lead in the market.
Concerning module cost and price, based on EnergyTrend’s data, the manufacturing cost for Chinese module manufacturers was between $0.19USD/watt and $0.22USD/watt, and that for European module manufacturers was at least 27% higher. Besides, since most of the Chinese module manufacturers had their own cell and wafer production lines, the lowest cost was $0.66USD/watt for products made outside of China and $0.54USD/watt for products made in China. Moreover, Chinese manufacturers can get refund on export tax, thus the price for Chinese products would be about 30% cheaper in European market.
With European governments continuously cutting the subsidies, in order for system investors to receive higher IRR, Chinese modules have become the first choice for manufacturers. EnergyTrend believed that although Europe tried to reduce the damage caused by Chinese products through imposing punitive tariff, the policy is like a double edged sword; if any mistakes occurred throughout the execution, it will seriously impact the future development of PV market in Europe.
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, because the demand’s turning slow and changes may be made toward Europe’s policy in August, the market is still stuck in wait-and-see mode. This week’s polysilicon spot market price continued to decline. For cell, due to the decreasing demand, the price for normal grade products continued to decrease. Also, the decision of some manufacturers to purchase normal grade products has caused the average price to go downward. For module, there may be changes toward European and Japanese markets, thus the future impact is still unpredictable. Although the Chinese government has come up with new subsidy policies, the actual result is yet to be observed. Due to the unpredictable market demand, price has declined. The market for thin-film and PV inverter is also being affected.

Ministry of Commerce of People’s Republic of China (MOFCOM) announced a few days ago that they will start to impose anti-dumping tariffs on the polysilicon products made in USA and Korea since July 24th. China’s spot market is the first to react to it after several days of observation. There are rumors which said that some Chinese manufacturers may revise the price upward. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, current polysilicon price in China remains stable. However, downstream buyers can’t seem to accept the price being raised. On the other hand, Taiwanese manufacturers have started to contact US suppliers after the policy has been announced, hoping to see if the price can be revised downward. EnergyTrend believes that since the grace period for Chinese modules shipped to Europe is coming to an end by August 6th and buyers/sellers also need some time to discuss how they are going to share the deposit towards polysilicon shipped to China, the market is still in wait-and-see mode before the end of July. Things may not be clear until the result is finalized in August. 
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, like mentioned above, sellers’ price revision is just some rumors to test the market reaction. In fact, the price hasn’t changed significantly. This week’s polysilicon price remains stable. For silicon wafer, the market is still waiting to see the future development. Since buyers are not willing to place orders and sellers are not going to lower the price, this week’s silicon wafer price remains steady. For cell, price of Chinese manufacturers continues to drop. In addition, mono-si cell price has also droppeds and causeds the average price to continuously declines. For module, because Chinese manufacturers have revised the price downward and most of the second/third-tier manufacturers have started to clear out the inventory, this week’s price comes to $0.688USD/watt.

China polysilicon manufacturers have started to raise prices, according to research by EnergyTrend, a research subsidiary of TrendForce. Some downstream manufacturers have agreed to adjust prices, but the price change has been incremental. In Taiwan, prices remained flat, due to U.S. manufacturers’ refusal to budge on prices and demand doubts, manufacturers need to carefully maneuver in the spot market. With major policy directions in place, all that remains is the confirmation and execution of policy details, said EnergyTrend. Since the policy changes were not far off from industry estimations, spot market’s reaction and results have been reasonable.
The spot market’s overall performance is as described above. Upstream and downstream manufacturers in the Chinese market have accepted price raises. However, the market in Taiwan has remained unchanged. Parties in the silicon wafer market are still in a wait and see mode with buyers unwilling to place orders, and sellers refusing tolower prices. Prices have remained flat this week in the silicon wafer market.  Prices were unchanged in the cell market, as Chinese manufacturers stabilized product prices, and Taiwanese manufacturers still observing future developments.

China’s battery cell manufacturers including Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), Coslight Group and others are gradually gaining ground, and more active than Japanese and Korean manufacturers in production capacity, according to research by EnergyTrend, a research subsidiary of TrendForce. A hidden worry accompanying the rise of Chinese packers in main supply chains is profits will continue to fall in the lithium battery industry.
Chinese battery on the rise as supply chain expands
Lithium batteries are a critical component in handheld consumer electronic products, and from 2000 onwards were widely adopted in cell phones. Starting in 2004, Korea quickly picked up in laptop battery assembly , and in the wake of Japan’s battery safety issues, China entered the battery supply chain in 2008. This transformed the lithium battery supply chain from being dominated by Japan to being divided among Japan, Korea and China.
In terms of development threshold for lithium batteries, cell phones, cameras and other consumer products tend to have low electricity consumption due to the product’s small size. These products only require a single battery cell as the power source, and have a simple battery assembly   process. In general, price/performance ratio is the key in these applications, with Japan, China, and Korea taking over the sector’s supply chain. In contrast, higher electricity consumption in laptop systems tends to use multi-cell to reach the required voltage and electric current resulting in higher safety thresholds. The market is mostly led by Japan and Korean battery manufacturers at the moment. 
China’s large labor force and quickly growing domestic demand is cultivating the domestic lithium battery industry that covers upstream battery materials manufacturers, midstream cell manufacturers to downstream battery assembly for both consumer products and power products.
At the moment many important consumer devices have chosen China as their battery assembly base, which has drawn a large number of cell or packer to settle down in China. Japanese and Korean battery manufacturers have established production bases in China, which in turn increased China’s battery industry yield rates. As polymer battery production expansion eases, Chinese cell manufacturers are still actively implementing expansion plans. The market potential for Chinese cell manufacturers should not be underestimated. Even the highly popular Apple smart phone supply chain has recently added Chinese cell manufacturers.

Arrival of low profit era with vertical integration of midstream and downstream manufacturers
In response to the gradual drop in cell prices, cell manufacturers, such as Sony, Samsung, LG Chem, ATL, BYD and others, are also changing management strategy and shifting roles in the supply chain towards battery assembly. Other prismatic battery and polymer battery are completely dominating the single battery assembly supply.
The current rate of cylindrical battery manufacturer’s in house assembly has reached more than 50%, and for Japanese battery manufacturers the rate has exceeded 70%. Prismatic battery mostly applied in cell phones are nearly 100% assembled by cell manufacturers. Due to high levels of customization, almost all polymer battery is assembled by cell manufacturers, and the only time they are handed over to packers   is for multi-cell applications. Cylindrical batteries mostly use multi-cell , with a majority assembled by professional pack makers.
To cross into the battery assembly supply chain, cell manufacturers sometimes will lower cell prices to attract battery assembly orders, since they control key components for single-cell and multi-cell applications. Looking at the long term development of oversupply, battery cell prices are expected to fall for consecutive quarters. In terms of battery assembly profit developments cell and packer  manufacturers are expected to enter a vicious cycle that will forcefully change the upstream and downstream relationship between cell and pack manufacturers to an increasingly cooperative and competitive relationship.
Currently, cylindrical battery price performance in 3Q reflects a downtrend in high-capacity cell. Objectively, this shows increased usage of high-capacitycell. The pricing trend also reasonably reflects dropping prices correlated with large product volume. The proportion of high capacity batteries continued to rise in the polymer battery sector. With many new tabletsto be released on the market in 3Q, many are abandoning multi-cell to improve the product’s outer appearance. Many have switched to using higher capacity single-cell deployment due to cost concerns. Competition is also more intense in high capacity battery cell with a quarterly decline of 3.3%, about the same drop as last quarter. The decline in low capacity battery has been gradual, and reflects fewer end-market applications. As a result battery prices have dipped only slightly.

                                Launch of EU-China new agreement leads to unpredictable PV price in the third quarter                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130812-5504.html,"

The new agreement between China and Europe on EU imports of Chinese solar panels has officially been launched. The result of the minimum price and volume limit, which the industry is most concerned about, has also been released. The minimum price of Chinese modules shipped to Europe from now on will be €0.56/Watt. Although the amount of volume quota hasn’t been finalized, the industry has considered 7GW/year as a reasonable amount. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the minimum price agreed by China and Europe is higher than what Chinese manufacturers proposed earlier and lower than European manufacturers’ production costs. In addition, the decomposition of unit cost may allow manufacturers that specialize in certain areas to raise the price, thus price may be unpredictable in the third quarter.
Taiwan’s cell price may go downward in the third quarter. Since the new agreement didn’t bring too much pressure on Chinese manufacturers, changes have been made toward the orders that were originally transferred to Taiwanese manufacturers in order to avoid risks. For now, both OEM product price and sales price have declined. As indicated by the price investigation, OEM product price in Taiwan’s cell industry has dropped below $0.2/Watt and the price of first-tier manufacturers has dropped to $0.19/Watt. For mainstream products, although sales price of first-tier manufacturers remains at $0.4/Watt, the price of second-tier manufacturers has dropped below $0.4/Watt. Besides, because the new agreement actually benefits first-tier Chinese manufacturers, quite a few manufacturers have started to cancel the orders, delay shipments, and choose to use their own products first. According to several Taiwanese manufacturers, the current order status of the third quarter remains in good shape. Shipments to Europe, USA, and Japan are all relatively steady. The orders that are affected are the ones transferred from Chinese manufacturers. However, it may have different impact on each manufacturer due to different order quantity placed by Chinese manufacturers.
On the other hand, the decomposition of cost is likely to have a notable impact on price. Deducting the manufacturing cost of modules and cells, upstream polysilicon and silicon wafer manufacturers may pave the way for further price growth. Several silicon wafer manufacturers indicate that previous price revision was mainly on modules and cells, silicon wafer and polysilicon manufacturers didn’t benefit from it at all. The new agreement that sets a minimum price on modules can help silicon wafer manufacturers to revise the price upward. Based on EnergyTrend’s estimation, the difference between the price of normal-grade products and the above cost structure is about 30%-35%, and that between the price of high-efficiency products and the above cost structure is 25%-30%. Therefore, polysilicon and silicon wafer manufacturers are intended to revise the price recently.
	Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, both upstream and downstream manufacturers in the Chinese and Taiwanese market have accepted the price to be revised upward. This week’s polysilicon price continues to increase with average price reaching $16.321USD/kg, a 0.12% rise. For silicon wafer, future price can be unpredictable with sellers refusing to lower the price. Yet, this week’s average price remains stable. For cell, Taiwanese manufacturers’ cell price has started to decline.

                                The market share of diversified residential market may exceed 50% in 2015, high-efficiency products are becoming the trend in PV industry                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130819-5531.html,"

TetraSun, a high-efficiency silicon PV cell manufacturer, was merged by First Solar recently. By officially entering the silicon PV cell territory, First Solar is planning to pilot-run 100MW high-efficiency mono-si cells in 2014 and start mass production in 2015. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, from process equipment producers and cell module manufacturers to material suppliers, they all have come up with several solutions involving high-efficiency products. It’s obvious that high-efficiency products have become the trend in PV industry. 
EnergyTrend indicates that roof-top systems have become the focus of subsidy policies, which causes the market share of diversified markets such as residential systems and small/medium commercial systems to continuously increase in Europe, North America, and Japan. Based on EnergyTrend’s estimation, the market share of diversified residential market is likely to exceed 50% by 2015. Relevant users in this market pay special attention to performance during the facility evaluation because they are hoping to replace conventional power with solar power. Relatively, the price range that they can accept is larger. Therefore, the visibility of high-efficiency products will significantly increase in the future.
Besides, since the minimum price has been set according to the new agreement between China and Europe and most of the subsidy has been allocated to the diversified residential market, it will put pressure on Chinese manufacturers that specialize in cost. Also, it will allow the countries that specialize in technology, such as Taiwan, Japan, USA, and Europe, a chance to take a break. 
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, both upstream and downstream manufacturers in China and Taiwan have accepted the price to be revised upward. This week’s polysilicon price continues to increase. For silicon wafer, major silicon wafer manufacturers are planning to revise the price upward. Since they are still bargaining the price with the buyers, this week’s average price remains stable. For cell, Taiwanese manufacturers are intending to lower the price to maintain capacity utilization rate.  For module, since Chinese manufacturers are observing the development of quota allocation, this week’s lowest price turned out to be US$ 0.55/Watt.

                                Unsolved Financial Pressure and Over-Investment Doubt Lead to PV Subsidy Cut in Europe                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130826-5554.html,"

The Czech government may revise PV subsidy plans by cancelling most of the solar subsidies starting from 2014 and mapping out the ceiling power price to solve the issues regarding increasing power price. Currently, the draft legislation is still being assessed by the Czech parliament. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, from what the Czech government is trying to do now – cancel PV subsidy and set the ceiling price, it shows that the potential financial burden and increasing power price have become serious issues for the Czech government. 
The wide promotion on renewable energy may indirectly trigger power price to go up. As observed by EnergyTrend, due to higher generation cost on renewable energy compared with conventional power and the rising penetration rate of renewable energy, the generation cost has also been raised for power companies. Besides, installing a large amount of renewable energy systems will bring huge burden to grid companies’ operating and system securities, and thus boost the companies’ operating maintenance expenses. In addition, relevant nations’ surcharges also increase each year. Based on Germany’s experiences, the surcharge fee increased as the accumulated amount of PV system installations increases each year. In order to maintain profit, manufacturers have started to transfer the cost burden to the consumers, which affect the living expenses for the general public. Therefore, people have begun to pay more attention to the increasing power price. 
On the other hand, the accelerated growth of PV and other renewable energy in Europe is positively correlated to Europe’s subsidy plans. However, the economic recession has brought down the momentum in Europe. The long-term subsidies brought by accelerated growth of the system installations can be quite a pressure towards relevant nations’ financial affairs. Furthermore, due to the 20-year fixed-rate subsidy and the rapid decline on the power generation cost, a large number of investors have decided to invest because of the stable and outstanding ROI rate. But given that over-investment may lead to market bubbles, the countries that widely promote renewable energy (such as Europe and USA) have continuously revised subsidies downward or even cancelled the subsidies. 
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, which causes poly price to continuously increase. For silicon wafer, the price of normal-grade multi-si wafers continues to drop. For mono-si wafer, this week’s price is unchanged from last week. For module, being pressured by both first/third-tier manufacturers, second-tier manufacturers face price dilemma.

                                Wafer Manufacturers Plan to Raise Prices in Face of Growing Polysilicon Costs                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130902-5572.html,"

As prices of China’s polysilicon spot market continue its upward ascend, it triggered price hikes in Asia’s polysilicon market that in turn caused cost increases for wafer manufacturers. Continual raw material price upticks are compressing silicon wafer manufacturers’ profits. Under operation pressure, wafer manufacturers are also considering raising silicon wafer prices. 
TrendForce pointed out Chinese polysilicon market’s continual price surge, which has shown no signs of decline, indicates a beneficial exterior environment for manufacturers operations. Therefore, price increases are unlikely to stop anytime soon. Although, the Chinese government has imposed anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports in an attempt to increase the use of domestically produced polysilicon, Chinese polysilicon manufacturers product quality, costs, and shipment capacity still lags behind large international brands. As a result, there were no significant decreases in China’s imports and purchase of raw materials. The industry still relies heavily on raw material imports. However, since China’s polysilicon anti-dumping duties came into effect, the custom process period for imported raw materials has been extended. In addition, uncertainties surrounding future market development have caused suppliers to be rather passive in preparing raw materials. As a result prices in the polysilicon spot market remain high.
Besides these factors, from a current cost perspective there is still room for minor price adjustments. After EU and China reached a new agreement recently, module prices were at about €0.56/watt (US$ 0.74/watt) and has nearly become the base price used to calculate costs in the industry. By deducting module and cell manufacturing costs from this price, silicon wafer prices can be maintained at about US$ 0.3/watt. From a cost perspective, silicon wafer manufacturers still believe there is room for price adjustments. In general wafer manufacturers psychology tends to orient towards making up with price upticks since they believe they had not raised prices in the last price wave.
China’s polysilicon spot market performance maintained a high price this week. In addition to the above market conditions, this week’s polysilicon prices continued its price increase of 0.33% to the Average Selling Price (ASP). In the polysilicon wafer market, normal grade item price trends have stabilized, and this week’s average prices have remained flat. However, mono-si wafers have maintained stable prices, with no obvious price fluctuations this week and unchanged weekly prices. Cell prices also were in a similar situation as prices were kept at previous levels. However, prices for modules continued to plunge, as second tier manufacturers faced challenges from first tier and third tier manufacturers both in price and sales channel. In addition, as the module market enters off-season, ASP has continued its downward spiral.

Solar developers have submitted Feed-in Tariff (FiT) bids in the second half year and an open bidding process will be completed by mid-September. Since this is the first bids in 2H13 and it may be held only once in the second half year, many solar developers have participated in the bidding process. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, although the bidding was initiated to allocate a capacity of 100MW solar power, out of the 100MW that was allocated, projects worth of only 45MW have been sanctioned. Thus, the chance to win the bids is lower than 50%. 
Solar developers that participated in the bidding indicate that they are determined to win the bids due to the following reasons – tax rate has continuously dropped in the second half year, capacity being allocated in the bidding has decreased, average discount rate has been revised upward significantly in the first half year, and more solar developers have participated in the bidding process. According to EnergyTrend, in order to win the bids, solar developers are generous about the discount rate. In addition, EnergyTrend estimates that the lowest discount rate for the bids may exceed more than 5% while there may be more than a few projects with discount rate above 10%. The average discount rate is likely to fall between 7%-8%.
On the other hand, due to the increased discount rate and revision on the FiT, solar developers have revised the cost for Balance of Systems (BOS) downward to maintain the lowest IRR. Price for other products, such as inverters, mounting systems, wires, and high-low pressure grid-connections has also continuously declined. Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, inverter price has dropped to US$0.2-0.15/watt while module price remains at around NT$70,000/kw. Price for mounting systems has dropped from NT$2,500 in the beginning of 2013 to NT$2,000. Rumor has it that price for some manufacturers has even dropped below NT$2,000. Moreover, price for high-low pressure grid-connections has also declined from NT$23,000 to NT$20,000. Decreased range for other products is about 10%-20%.
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price has remained at RMB135/kg-RMB140/kg with average price reaching US$16.70/kg, a 0.54% rise. For silicon wafer, both buyers and sellers still bargained over the price, thus last week’s price remained unchanged. Cell price continued to decline. Module price remained the same. However, due to the poor foundation and other technology challenges, thin-film module price has dropped again .

Many countries have successively announced PV policies recently. While some of the policies aim to increase the amount of solar system installations, others focus on substantially cutting the scope and amount of subsidies. These policies will deeply impact the future development of PV market. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, most PV manufacturers are conservative about the recent market condition in order to carefully evaluate the effect after the PV policies are being implemented. It’s not likely for the manufacturers to execute any plans until the market condition becomes clear. 
According to EnergyTrend’s latest Gold Member Report, due to various market uncertainties, most polysilicon manufacturers have temporarily suspended capacity expansions recently. Only few manufacturers (such as Tokuyama) have completed capacity expansions as planned. Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, Tokuyama’s phase one capacity of 6,200 tons in Malaysia has mostly been focused on semiconductor products. Only a small amount of products has been provided for PV manufacturers. On the other hand, shipments for the top five global manufacturers (GCL, OCI, Wacker, REC, and Hemlock, in no particular order) represented more than 75% of the global shipment in the first half year. Shipments in the third quarter are likely to remain at the same level.

In terms of silicon wafers, future orders will mostly go to first-tier manufacturers. With industrial concentration intensifying, first-tier manufacutrers will be able to maintain high utilization rate. Even taking market uncertainties and cost into consideration, the first-tier Chinese manufacturers will still dominate the global market for silicon wafers. Second/third-tier manufacturers can only move toward the niche market or become subcontractors of first-tier manufacturer due to their lack of advantage in both capacity and cost. EnergyTrend estimates that the utilization rate of silicon wafers will be about 60% in 2013 and may reach 70% in 2014.

In terms of cells, due to the rapid changes in the market, most manufacturers have been quickly shifting between self-producing and outsourcing. However, most cell manufacutrers prefer OEM orders to reduce market uncertainties and to pursue more stable cash flow and lower risk. Besides, the elimination and integration of cell and silicon wafer capacities have become clearer. Capacity expansions will not be significant while most of the expansions will be focused on acquisitions. EnergyTrend indicates that the utilization rate of cells in 2013 and 2014 is about 65%, which is not that different.
Judging from spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price has remained at the level of RMB130/kg-RMB140/kg, with this week’s average price reaching US$17.0/kg, a 1.8% rise. For silicon wafers, both buyers and sellers are still bargaining over the price. Some manufacturers indicate that they are still hoping to revise price upward but it will have to depend on future market condition. As for normal-grade silicon wafers, given that their price has continued to decline, the average price of multi-si wafers has fallen to US$0.885/Watt, a 0.11% drop. For cells, manufacturers indicate that they may not be able to revise price upward, thus this week’s price remains stable. For modules, this week’s price also remains steady.

                                Japan’s Zero Nuclear Power Issue Triples PV Market Demand in 2013                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130924-5662.html,"


	Regular inspections have been conducted on the No.4 reactor at the Oi nuclear power plant. However, delay on the inspections has once again led to Japan’s “zero nuclear power” status. Since nuclear power is still the major source of base-load electricity while other units are still applying for re-activation, it’s estimated that it will take at least half a year to complete security inspection. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the “zero nuclear power” state will force Japan to accelerate the development of renewable energy. Among all, demand from solar energy is likely to go upward. The total amount of grid-connected installation may reach 7GW in 2013, which will triple the installation amount last year. 

	 

	According to the data collected by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan (FEPC), Japan’s base-load electricity mainly focuses on Hydropower (inflow type) and nuclear power. Coal-fired and gas-fired power would belong to medium-load electricity and Fuel oil and other energies would be categorized in peak-load electricity. Ever since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, most of the nuclear power plants have been suspended, which has lowered the usage of nuclear power from 33% in 2010 to 2.15% in 2012. The power shortage caused by the decline of nuclear power has been filled by thermal power generation. According to the statistical data, the top ten power companies have significantly increased the usage of thermal power generation from 59.05% in 2010 to 89.82% in 2012, which caused Japan to import large quantities of coal, oil, natural gas and other fuels.

	Besides, from power supply and demand aspect, Japan’s supply and demand ratio has  remained at around 1.05 in the past three years. However, based on the total amount of power generated in 2010, the supply and demand ratio has dropped to 0.753 after deducting the amount of nuclear power generated. In order to solve the insufficient power supply problems caused by the suspension of nuclear power plant after 2011, increasing the usage of renewable energy has become another solution for the Japanese government and manufacturers, aside from the solution to adopt more thermal power generation. 

	 

	As indicated by relevant data, power companies have continued to purchase more power generated from wind and solar energy. According to the data, Japan’s top ten power companies have purchased much more power generated from solar energy since 2008. The annual growth rate increased from 9.25% in 2008 to 45.89% in 2011. As for wind energy, although the annual growth rate has been fluctuating, power purchased by power companies has also continued to increase. On the other hand, according to EnergyTrend’s statistics, the amount of grid-connected installations in Japan has continued to increase. In addition, it will take at least half a year for nuclear power plants to meet the security check request and re-activation safety requirements and it would be difficult to project the time needed to get the re-activation approval from the local government, thus demand in the Japanese market have obviously gone upward this year.

	Judging from spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remained between RMB130/kg-RMB140/kg. Since average price slightly dropped to the range of RMB132/kg-RMB135/kg, last week’s average price came to US$16.985/kg, a 0.09% drop. For silicon wafers, both buyers and sellers are still bargaining over the price. Some manufacturers indicate that they are still hoping to revise price upward but it will have to depend on future market condition. Last week’s silicon wafer price remained flat. For cells, demand in September was 20%-30% higher than that in August. Moreover, with the increased Japanese orders, cell price for Taiwan’s first-tier manufacturers slightly increased again with last week’s average price reaching US$0.391/Watt, a 0.26% rise.

                                Countervailing Duty Imposed on Chinese Imports of US Polysilicon May Have Limited Impact on Price                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20130927-5674.html,"

Ministry of Commerce of People’s Republic of China (MOFCOM) recently announced that there were subsidies to the US polysilicon under investigation which led to substantive damages toward China’s domestic industry. Thus, countervailing duty of 6.5% has been imposed on two of the US manufacturers, Hemlock and AE Polysilicon. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, most of the Chinese polysilicon manufacturers have resumed production, which will increase polysilicon capacity. Hence, the anti-subsidy duty will have limited impact on price as price is not likely to increase in the future. 
As Indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, the annual growth rate for Chinese imports of US polysilicon was about 85% in 2012. In addition, based on the data announced by MOFCOM, the amount of the imported polysilicon that is subsidized by the US government has continued to go upward. It increased by almost 100% in the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Judging from the demand of Chinese solar-grade polysilicon in 2012, the proportion of imports from the US accounted for more than 20%.

EnergyTrend believes that the anti-subsidy duty will have limited impact on polysilicon market price. Since China has announced the anti-dumping tariff before, the tax rate imposed on US manufacturers have reached 53.3%-57%. In another word, the market price has already been affected at that time. Moreover, the anti-subsidy duty is far less than the tax rate mentioned above. Therefore, market price is not likely to fluctuate significantly this time. On the other hand, due to the less damage towards the Korean manufacturer, OCI, and European manufacturers throughout the polysilicon anti-dumping investigation, Chinese manufacturers have turned to European and Korean manufacturers for purchase. Yet, Chinese polysilicon manufacturers still face tough challenges from the worldwide competition.
The rising of the Chinese domestic market causes polysilicon price in China to gradually increase, which also allows Chinese polysilicon manufacturers to resume production. For example, TBEA’s capacity of 12 thousand tons will be mass produced by the end of the year; CSG has resumed production this August after eleven months of delay on polysilicon production; and Sinosico has also aggressively worked on production re-activation. EnergyTrend believes that it’s not likely for polysilicon price to continue increasing due to the falling downstream market prices and the Chinese manufacturers’ resumed production, which will lead to flexible supply in the future. 
Judging from spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remains between RMB132/kg-RMB135/kg. Affected by the result of countervailing duty, buyers have requested certain manufacturers to lower the price, which causes this week’s average price to reach US$16.975/kg, a 0.06% drop. For silicon wafers and cells, this week’s price remains steady. For modules, the competition between USA and Japan is intense. The price continues to drop with this week’s price reaching US$0.674/Watt, a 0.44% drop.

IKEA, a Swedish company and world’s largest furniture retailer, announces that they are branching out into the solar market and will provide total solutions for roof-top solar system users. IKEA indicates that they will form strategic alliance with Hanergy, a Chinese thin-film solar company. In addition to the solar system installations in its own worldwide branches, the company also offers residential and commercial solar power systems. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, there are two indicators of IKEA branching out into the solar market. One is that it may change the existing solar channels and another is that PV distributed market will become the mainstream.
Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, IKEA has been observing the roof-top market for the past three years. The company believes that renewable energy will be the major supply for residential and commercial energy in the future, thus they have started to evaluate the possibility in entering the solar market three years ago. Meanwhile, they have been looking for partners to work with within the Chinese market. Judging from the data announced this time, the cost for the total solution provided by IKEA in UK was approximately US$9200/3.36kW. EnergyTrend estimates that module price may be between US$0.54-0.55/watt, which shows IKEA’S strong procurement. Retailers like IKEA may become the regional trade centers for modules in the future. Furthermore, with the additional technology consultant and installation services being provided, it’s likely for companies applying EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and construction) or the online trading systems under development to be replaced by these types of retailers.
IKEA plans to extend the business model to the entire Europe within a short period of time, which shows that roof-top market has become the mainstream in Europe. As indicated by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association’s data, 53% of the solar panels in the European market have been used on residential and commercial areas in 2012, while 58% of the market demand in UK came from residential and commercial market. Moreover, subsidies to ground-mounted projects are likely to be ceased. In EU PVSEC this year, many companies have proposed self-consumption solar solutions, which shows that PV distributed markets have become the mainstream in Europe.

Judging from spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remained between RMB132/kg-RMB135/kg. Since anti-subsidy didn’t have much impact on the market price, manufacturers were not willing to lower the price. Thus, last week’s average price remained flat. For silicon wafers, the average price for multi-si wafers remained steady. However, the price for mono-si wafers was slightly higher than that in the domestic market due to the increased demand from Taiwan and Korea. Last week’s average price for mono-si wafers was US$1.198/piece, a 0.34% rise. For cells, due to the increased demand from the Chinese domestic market and the high utilization rate for most of the manufacturers, last week’s average price increased to US$0.392/watt, a 0.26% rise. For modules, the utilization rate for first-tier manufacturers remained high. In addition, the release of the policies drove the demand in the domestic market which caused last week’s average price to increase to US$0.675/watt, a 0.15% rise.

                                Better Prospect in PV Market Leads to Increased Polysilicon Demand in 1Q14                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131014-5728.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the intensive pricing competition in the PV market has gradually come to an end. Due to the increased demand in the emerging markets, solar system demand in 2014 is likely to rise substantially. As indicated by EnergyTrend’s data, deducting the amount of solar system installations which haven’t completed grid-connection in 2012, the total amount of grid-connected installations is likely to reach 28.6GW in 2013. As for the total amount of shipment in 2013, it will be around 33.3GW, which shows that the overall supply within the PV market can be somewhat sufficient. Although the total amount of module shipment may be about 40GW in 2014, the actual amount of grid-connected installations will only be around 39.5GW. Module supplies, therefore, may be somewhat restricted. 

The oversupply situation in the global PV industry within the past few years have led to the decreased polysilicon price. Since most of the new manufacturers continue to suffer from losses, they have suspended production line operation successively since the second half of 2012, which caused global polysilicon capacity to continue to decline. However, market demand may increase in 2014. As it may take about a quarter to get the polysilicon production line restarted, EnergyTrend believes that polysilicon supply may be restrained or even become insufficient in 1Q14. 
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s data, global polysilicon output is around 0.17 million tons in 2013, which represents 31GW of supply. The average quarterly supply is between 7GW-8GW. Looking into 1Q14, EnergyTrend estimates that demand of silicon wafers will be around 8GW. But based on current output, polysilicon supply is around 0.04 million tons, which is 7.2GW of supply. On the other hand, manufacturers are still optimistic about the demand in 4Q13 with current shipment condition remaining normal. In addition, it’s projected that inventory level will remain the same. According to the current condition, EnergyTrend believes that polysilicon supply may become more restricted in 1Q14.

EnergyTrend indicates that whether the supply shortage can be solved or not will have to depend on the following variables: how fast Chinese polysilicon manufacturers can restart the production, new production capacity status (e.g. Hanwha, Tokuyama, OCI, etc), and the ratio of new capacity in semi-conductor grade and solar-grade product. If the progress for the above variables can meet or even surpass expectations, the condition of polysilicon supply and demand may be improved from the end of 1Q14 to the beginning of 2Q14.

                                Taiwanese PV Manufacturers Seize Opportunities in Monocrystalline Market as PV Self-Consumption Increases                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131021-5748.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, demand for PV self-consumption continues to increase in Europe due to the decreased FiT and the increased electricity price and surcharge fees for grid-connection. Besides, the installation area for roof-top systems is somewhat limited, thus relevant users mostly pay more attention on the amount of electricity generated. This, along with concerns toward visual and aesthetic quality, has caused demand for mono-si cells to increase significantly. 
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, mono-si cell orders substantially rose among Taiwan’s cell manufacturers recently. The proportion of mono-si cell shipment has also been raised for relevant manufacturers. The investigation result showed that that the proportion of mono-si cell shipment for Taiwan’s first-tier manufacturers has increased from 5% in the beginning of the year to more than 20%. Starting from the second quarter, mono-si cell demand has started to increase. Orders in the second half year are likely to continuously increase because of the growth in the Japanese market. In addition, demand in the fourth quarter may further increase. As for mono-si cell efficiency, it has  remained above 19.2%. The advanced technology will likely bring the product efficiency to 19.4% from 4Q13 to 1Q14. 
On the other hand, with the concept of self-consumption gradually maturing, roof-top systems have become the mainstream in the region that has a matured PV market. Based on the data, 53% of the roof-top systems have been used on residential and commercial areas in the European market in 2012. EnergyTrend estimates that the proportion will increase to around 55% in 2013 and close to 60% by 2014. Aside from residential and commercial areas, roof-top systems can also be used on industrial areas as the proportion of self-consumption within the industrial areas begins to increase, which also helps raise the ratio of roof-top systems within the global PV market. 
According to EnergyTrend’s data, roof-top market currently represents 60% of the global PV market. The percentage is the highest, about 80%, in the European regions. As for Northern America and Asia and Pacific, it’s around 50%. EnergyTrend indicates that the market share of roof-top systems will continuously increase in Europe. Moreover, under the influence of other PV policies, mono-si products will become the major products promoted by Taiwan’s manufacturers.

Judging from spot market’s overall performance, although last week’s average price remained steady, certain manufacturers have planned to expand the production capacity due to the increased market demand and high utilization rate for major manufacturers. For wafers, last week’s average price of multi-si wafers was a 0.11% drop. It’s because some buyers used better payment terms in exchange for better price. For mono-si wafers, last week’s average price remained flat. For cells, last week’s average price also remained steady. For modules, last week’s average price was unchanged. The price gap has reduced between first-tier and second-tier manufacturers as second-tier’s utilization rate has significantly increased. It is worth observing how the future pricing trend will develop from this point forward.

                                Growing Demand of PV Power Plants Leads to Increased Investment in PV Power Plants                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131028-5770.html,"

With countries successively releasing PV subsidy policies, the cumulative amount of grid-connected installations has gradually increased. Solar power plants have even become the major investment product in the eyes of international investors. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the oversupply issue still exists in recent solar market. Major manufacturers choose to enter the power plant area in order to expand the market for their own-brands and to earn long-term stable Return-on-Investment (ROI). However, the increased operating time in power plants has caused many issues that would affect profit to pop up. This leaves potential risks of decreased ROI in related investments. 

	The research manager of EnergyTrend, Arthur Hsu, indicates that the ratio of roof-top solar systems and ground-mounted power plants from 2012 to 2016 is 6:4. Regardless of the type of installation method used, the problem mostly encountered by power plants is that module efficiency declines faster than expected. Other problems include product warranty and improper design. For example, Satcon, a major US solar inverter manufacturer, declared bankruptcy and caused power plants that use Satcon’s central inverters to stand in a difficult position when product warranty and maintenance have been suspended. These bring unknown risks to power plant investors. Although power plants can maintain operation and obtain warranty through replacing the components, investment cost may still rise and thus impact the original ROI.

	 

Given that the investment evaluation for certain projects turned out to be relatively inaccurate, in some cases actual ROI may also be lower than expected. For example, in order to achieve higher ROI, certain investors didn’t take warranty cost into consideration during the initial stage of evaluation, which led to problems when the warranty period ended being far shorter than the subsidy period. This can bring quite a few confusions to investors. Because of this, power plant investors and those that plan to get involved in power plants pay more attention to maintenance and warranty. Thus, the market size also gradually increases.
Based on the trend, EnergyTrend is going to hold its first PVforum 2013 – Market Status and Future Development for Solar Power Plants in Asia on October 31st (Thursday) at Taipei International Convention Center. Our research mangers, Arthur Hsu and Jason Huang, will present keynote speeches regarding solar power plants and overall market prospect. We invite industry experts from related fields to exchange information regarding power plant maintenance/warranty and investment evaluation with us. Also, we welcome all the medias to come join us.
Judging from spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remained between RMB130/kg-RMB140/kg, with average price slightly increasing. For wafers, the demand for multi-si wafers increased and manufacturers’ utilization rate remained high. Last week’s multi-si wafer price slightly rose with average price. As for mono-si wafers, last week’s average price remained steady. For cells, since price on the normal-grade products for second/third-tier manufacturers have started to loosen and manufacturers have begun to pay more attention on inventory due to the off-peak season in the market. For modules, while the increased utilization rate led to the increased demand in high-efficiency modules in the fourth quarter, the mainstream products will turn to normal-grade modules with cheaper price in the future. Thus, manufacturers have tried hard to see if there can be better deals on the price.

                                PV Manufacturers Initiate Expansion Plans                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131101-5799.html,"

PV Taiwan 2013 kicked off on Oct. 30, 2013. Despite a smaller sized event compared to previous years, and less popularity, observations by EnergyTrend, a green energy subsidiary under TrendForce have a positive outlook for 2014. The industry’s expansion plans that have been on hold for years have finally been reinitiated. Companies equipment spending will definitely grow next year.
Most of the manufacturers that attended the PV forum this year were upstream equipment manufacturers and downstream system manufacturers, according to EnergyTrend observations from the forum. Major Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers have expansion plans, according to an upstream manufacturer. For equipment manufacturers, this is a clear equipment spending sign from companies. To obtain related orders, equipment makers have actively deployed business strategies in the two markets. Companies in talks include main manufacturers in China and Taiwan, and will confirm the order scale by the end of this year, said a related manufacturer. Aside from expanding production capacity, improvements in production technology have also driven equipment spending. Since most manufacturers will be focused on Passivated Emitter and Rear Cells (PERC) production technology next year, existing product line equipment needs to be upgraded. Therefore, PERC related equipment orders have also become a major target for equipment manufacturers.
Another highlight at the forum was systems, especially maintenance and system consulting in later phases. As power station investments become increasingly important, previously hidden investment protocol issues have gradually surfaced with expanded investments. This has impacted PV power stations Return of Interest (ROI). To solve these risks, operation maintenance warranty and system inquiry are increasingly being valued by manufacturers. Related inquiries have increased at this year’s forum and at related manufacturers’ booths. Besides the above mentioned, another forum highlight has been acquisition. Companies from related industries including silicon wafers and cell manufacturers are in talks, according to EnergyTrend’s understanding. For instance, a large first tier silicon wafer manufacturer’s acquisition case is entering final stages. The company will be able to distance itself from competitors once production capacity is confirmed. In another merger case, a first tier cell company has also been rumored to acquire cell production capacity from another group’s cell subsidiary to quickly meet cell production expansion capacity targets,.
From the current market overview, this week’s polysilicon prices remained flat as companies speculated future market developments. As for silicon wafer market, high multi-si wafer demands and high production capacity have caused prices to up 0.22 percent this week. Strong demands for mono-si wafers and manufacturers positive outlook for future market development has led to this week’s ASP incremental increase of 0.08 percent. Cell manufacturers’ production capacity on the other hand is tightening. Multi-si most efficient trading volume is about 17.2 percent and with large trade volumes, and active market inquiry, it is estimated prices will continue to grow later on. As a result, this week’s prices increased 0.26 percent. In the module market, Chinese manufacturers have begun to deploy their 2014 Chinese market strategies. Stronger module demands have raised this week’s ASP by 0.15 percent.

                                Closing of Japanese Thin-Film Maker Soltec Raises Concern for Future Equipment and Technology Development                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131111-5812.html,"

The alert is on again for the thin-film market. Japan’s Honda Group recently announced that they will close their CIGS thin-film technology subsidiary company, Honda Soltec, from the end of 1Q14 to the beginning of 2Q14. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the thin-film market is currently going through an extremely tough time and the situation is likely to persist in the short run. 
EnergyTrend has long been pessimistic about the future development of thin-film products. One reason is due to the si-base module manufacturers’ overcapacities that lead to the decreased module price, which in turn reduces the thin-film manufacturers’ room for price negotiations. Another reason is because the gap between the efficiency of thin-film products and si-base products is becoming bigger as the efficiency of si-based modules continues to improve. This causes thin-film products to gradually disappear from the mainstream market, and relevant manufacturers can only turn to the niche market. Therefore, with thin-film market prospect being poor and product competitiveness being weak, Honda Group is unwilling to continue to invest in it. Hence, Soltec had to be closed. 
On the other hand, EnergyTrend also focuses on the equipment and technology development of Soltec. Take Hanergy, a Chinese thin-film manufacturer, for example. They have showed strong interests in the acquisition of CIGS manufacturers, such as Solibro and MiaSole. Since Soltec’s market share has been quite large in Japan and they also have the commercialization experiences of products and sales, whether Hanergy will acquire Soltec in order to enter the Japanese market immediately and seize the customers from Solar Frontier remains to be seen. Besides, it’s worth observing whether Taiwan’s manufacturers will focus more onto this area as well. EnergyTrend indicates that there are only two CIGS technology companies, Sunshine PV and TSMC, left in Taiwan. It has been a tough journey for them to compete with the major manufacturers in terms of technology and scale. It’s believed that Soltec’s technology and market will somehow be beneficial to Taiwan’s manufacturers. If Taiwan’s manufacturers can work with Soltec through appropriate partnership, there may be whole new sparkle. 
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remained between RMB130/kg-RMB140/kg, with last week’s average price staying steady. For wafers, the demand for high-efficiency wafers continued to increase, which allowed wafer manufacturers to revise the price upward. Last week’s price increased with a 0.34% rise. For cells, manufacturers were more willing to expand production capacity. But certain cell manufacturers have started to lower price in order to avoid the drop in utilization rate caused by capacity expansion. Last week’s average price came to US$0.388/watt, a 1.02% drop. Whether the price lowering trend will extend to all manufacturers in the future remains to be seen.

GCL recently announced its 3Q13 net revenue and sales. Based on the results, the net sales of polysilicon and wafers significantly increased. GCL further indicates that the supply of polysilicon may not be able to meet the demand due to client’s high utilization rate and high demand forecast. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the market in 2014 will grow substantially, thus wafer and cell manufacturers will have expansion plans on production capacity while polysilicon manufacturers will be relatively conservative on the expansion. In 1Q14, it’s very likely that the supply may not be able to meet the demand. 
According to the information exchanged by EnergyTrend and other manufacturers/equipment manufacturers on PV Taiwan, major module, cell, and wafer manufacturers in both Taiwan and China have expansion plans. In fact, Taiwan’s major cell manufacturers are certain about the expansions in 2014. The expansion range for one of the first-tier cell manufacturers is even close to 100% while the rest of the manufacturers plan to expand above 100MW. As for wafers, first-tier manufacturers in both Taiwan and China have been very aggressive. Aside from being positive about future market growth, they enhance price and product spec to extend the gap with second/third-tier manufacturers. Through acquisition, outsourcing, and equipment upgrade, they can enhance production capacity and product spec. In terms of modules, rumors had it that a first-tier manufacturer in China plans to expand the capacity to 1GW. Meanwhile, several module manufacturers in Taiwan also plan to expand the capacity. The capacity for some manufacturers even increased multifold. Overall, EnergyTrend projects that the polysilicon demand will be about 8GW in 1Q14 while the supply will reach 39,500 tons, which is about 7.2GW. Besides, although inventory remains in good shape in 4Q13, EnergyTrend believes that polysilicon shortage is likely to happen in 1Q14 based on the current projection. 
On the other hand, as indicated by the 3Q13 net revenue and sales announced by GCL, polysilicon produced was about 35,531 tons in the first three quarters of 2013, an 8.1% rise compared to the 32,864 tons in the first three quarters of 2012. Polysilicon produced in 3Q13 was around 13,550 tons, a 77.6% rise compared to the 7,631 tons in 3Q12. As for sales, it was around 12,490 tons in the first three quarters of 2013, a 29.2% rise compared to the 9,669 tons in the first three quarters of 2012. Polysilicon sold in 3Q13 was around 4,018 tons, a 511.6% rise compared to the 657 tons in 3Q12. 
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remains between RMB135/kg-RMB140/kg. For wafers, manufacturers are able to revise the price upward and focus more on high-efficiency products to meet clients’ needs. This week’s price continues to go upward. For mono-si wafers, this week’s average price continues to fluctuate. For modules, there are some noises in December market. Chinese manufacturers have started to raise the level of their inventory. Overall, the Industry is turning more conservative in December, which causes the price to drop.

                                New Era Approaches as Gross Margin and Quantity of Lithium Battery Decrease                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131122-5852.html,"

According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, cylindrical battery price performance reflects a downtrend due to Polymer battery supply crowd out and thinner consumer electronic devices. In addition, medium-high capacity battery (2.8~3.0Ah) can reduce the number of pieces used. Under the circumstance where cost remains unchanged, medium-high capacity battery has gradually become a mainstream product. More manufacutrers have started to enter this market segment, which leads to the decreased medium-high capacity battery price. It’s projected that cylindrical battery price will decline by about 2.8% in 4Q13.
Clearer Battery Cell Segmentation
Currently, battery cells are segmented by capacity, which can be divided into three types – high, medium, and low capacity. Although >3.0Ah high capacity cells can be used on cylindrical batteries, the cost threshold of cylindrical batteries is too high and they would be difficult to meet the lightweight requirements of high-end products. Thus, polymer batteries are more suitable for high-end products. As for 2.8~3.0Ah medium-high capacity cells, their production technology is quite similar to that of 2.2Ah. Also, the unit price is not that different from 2.2Ah, and their volumes can be reduced efficiently. Therefore, 2.8~3.0Ah is the best choice for middle-end products to maintain cost and reduce volume. Last but not least, standard batteries are more suitable for low-end products which are more sensitive to cost. Due to standard battery’s larger market share, it’s more likely to go into mass production. But in terms of cost advantage, cylindrical battery seems to be the best choice in the short run. 

Increased Penetration rate of High Capacity Cylindrical Battery
EnergyTrend indicates that in terms of price, cylindrical battery reflects a downtrend from long-term perspective. In 4Q13, the number of battery cells used in a laptop has been reduced from 6 pieces to 3~4 pieces. Under the circumstance where endurance remains the same, the choosing of high capacity cells will definitely become a trend. Hence, cell manufacturers have started to produce more high capacity cells following the increased demand and appropriate adjustment on the production line. It in turn caused 2.8~3.0Ah battery cell price to decrease by 2.8% QoQ. 
The supply and demand is relatively balanced for polymer batteries while the price is also showing steady decline (-2% QoQ). The price drop is likely to be caused by routine equipment amortization. It’s estimated that the market share of polymer batteries will grow steadily due to the increased popularity of portable products. However, apart from Apple, polymer battery applications will still be limited to high-end products. So far, the biggest challenge for polymer batteries will be how to maintain stable supply while solving the inventory issues caused by customization.

                                Japan to Revise PV Subsidy Downward, Investment in PV System Installation may Increase in the Short Run                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131123-5855.html,"

Rumors have it that the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan (METI) is considering revising PV subsidy downward to JPN￥34/kWh in 2014 and JPN￥30/kWh in 2015. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, whether Japan’s subsidy cut will come true or not, it’s projected that Japan’s market demand in both 2014 and 2015 will remain strong. However, if the rumor turns out to be true, the amount of PV system installation is likely to increase substantially in Japan and in turn benefit Taiwanese manufacturers. 
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, Japan may revise PV subsidy downward by around 10% in 2014 and 2015, which is within the range estimated by the industry. Thus, it will still bring a certain level of profit and Return-on-Investment (ROI) to the manufacturers. EnergyTrend projects that Japan’s ROI will be around 17% if calculating based on the subsidy rate in 2015 while taking relevant cost changes into consideration. In contrast to other countries, Japan remains a region with a lot of profit in the global PV market. 
With the Heisei 25 fiscal year entering into the second half and the weather being increasingly less suitable for construction, EnergyTrend believes that the amount of PV system installation in Japan will increase significantly by the end of March 31st, 2014. Furthermore, although 19GW demand awaits Japan in 2014, the growth of grid can’t seem to catch up with that of PV system installation. Hence, PV demand is likely to grow steadily starting from 2015. 

In terms of the industrial side, EnergyTrend believes that Taiwanese manufacturers will be in good shape due to the OEM demand from Japan. Because Japan puts most of their focus on systems, they normally choose to outsource modules and cells, which benefits Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers. The Taiwanese manufacturers, in particular, tend to work closely with Japanese manufacturers on systems and outsourcing opportunities, as the partnership between Inventec and Toshiba shows. Meanwhile, the business model of using cells from Taiwan and modules from China is continuing to be implemented. By coming up with better value, they are hoping to create more demand. In 4Q13, Taiwanese manufacturers will be more aggressive towards module capacity expansion. Apart from obtaining outsourcing opportunities from Japanese manufacturers, they are also considering the options of producing cells and modules in Taiwan, and establishing a possible brand in China.
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remains high. Since there’s not much room for price negotiation, this week’s price remains steady. For wafers, recent shipments of major Chinese manufacturers are concentrated in the local market, which allows non-Chinese manufacturers to raise the price. Moreover, clients have shifted their needs toward high-efficiency products, thus this week’s price continues to go upward. For mono-si wafers, this week’s average price continue to fluctuate, a 0.75% drop. For cells, certain Chinese manufacturers successfully revised the price of high-efficiency products upward. Yet, the price of normal-grade products remains steady. This week’s average price increased with a 0.26% rise. For modules, Japan is likely to revise the subsidy downward. It’s estimated that the amount of PV system installation will increase substantially in the short run. Certain module manufacturers have started to stock up in case the demand will be too large. This week’s module price remains stable.

                                Wafer Manufacturers Re-Consider Contract Trading due to Supply Shortage and Increased Price                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131128-5876.html,"

Since orders have been continually finalized in December, PV demand is likely to remain strong during off-peak season in 4Q13. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, the overall PV demand is likely to remain high in 1Q14. In addition, the market will demand more high-efficiency products, which may lead to supply shortage for high-efficiency products. Therefore, contract trading, which has disappeared for a long time, may return to the wafer market.
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, wafer supply shortage started to appear in the end of October and the issue is not likely to be solved in the short run. Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, smaller manufacturers with better technology skills have mostly achieved full-production and price may continue to increase. Moreover, certain manufacturers reduce the use of OEM and switch to produce their own brands and in turn make better profit. For example, Chinese manufacturers, such as Phoenix Solar and Dahai, have come to Taiwan to promote their own brands. Certain cell manufacturers even arranged products to go through validation process.
Besides, supply shortage will allow wafer manufacturers to search for better deals. Based on EnergyTrend’s understanding, wafer manufacturers have gradually revised multi-si wafer price upward in the end of October. Over the past month, price has increased by 5% for certain manufacturers. Looking into December price, wafer manufacturers may be able to continuously revise the price upward. Furthermore, it’s projected that wafer supply shortage is likely to remain in 1Q14 with some manufacturers considering short-term contract trading. However, payment conditions, pricing methods, and client acceptance will be the critical factors to determine if this will work.

Although PV demand is increasing, the focus of the demand is slowly shifting to other segments within PV industry. Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, the growth of grid can’t seem to catch up with that of power plants in the world. China has started to shift the focus toward distributed PV applications. Meanwhile, lack of grid capacity has also become an issue in the Japanese market. Hence, demand growth for PV plants may slow down in 2014, but demand for high-efficiency products which are used on roof-top systems may further increase.
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, Chinese polysilicon price remains high and demand is still in good shape. Although output has increased, they were sold out in a short period of time. With spot and auxiliary material supply declining, this week’s price increased with a 0.01% rise. For multi-si wafers, supply shortage continues to exist. Chinese manufacturers have also reduced the supply towards Taiwanese manufacturers, which caused this week’s spot market price to continuously increase. For mono-si wafers, this week’s average price remains steady. For cells, since major manufacturers have achieved full-production and market condition is still in good shape, this week’s spot price continues to reflect an uptrend. For modules, this week’s price fluctuates,  a 0.15% rise. On the other hand, the rise of regional brands has brought challenges to conventional manufacturers through low-price strategy. The average price for inverters decreased with a 2.45% drop.

                                EU’s Anti-Dumping Tariffs on Chinese PV Solar Glass May Have Minimal Effect on PV Market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131210-5904.html,"

The European Union recently announced to impose anti-dumping tariff on Chinese solar glass manufacturers. A tariff rate of 17.1%-42.1% may be imposed on solar glass products. According to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, although the European Union has started another anti-dumping action on Chinese solar glasses, modules have been exempted from it. Thus, it will have very little effect on the global PV market.
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s data, the front panel  used for module packaging is the product that’s being investigated. Such product doesn’t require much use of technology. Hence, Chinese manufacturers use low-cost strategy to win a large amount of market share in the global market. In addition, since finished modules are not included in the investigation, products that use Chinese solar glass may still be exported to Europe. EnergyTrend believes that once the European Union starts the investigation, it will only benefit the glass manufacturers in Europe while production cost may increase for European module manufacturers.
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, since Chinese polysilicon price remained high and suppliers’ quotation continued to increase in December. Last week’s price reflected an uptrend. For multi-si wafers, supply shortage remained for high-efficiency products. Also, Chinese manufacturers have revised the price upward, which caused spot price to continuously rise. Last week’s average price increased with a 1.22% rise. For mono-si wafers, production has been fully utilized and demand has gone weak. Last week’s average price declined with a 0.84% drop. For cells, rumors had it that Chinese manufacturers may outsource more production to Taiwanese manufacturers due to their current full-production status. However, cell price hasn’t been revised upwards further with last week’s average price being steady. For modules, because product spec has been upgraded and demand has turned weak by the end of the year, buyers and sellers both became more conservative regarding inventory control to avoid price drop from too many inventory. Last week’s module price remained flat.

                                Polysilicon’s Market Momentum Continues, Suppliers to Increase Contractual Polysilicon Price                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131215-5921.html,"

EnergyTrend indicates that although PV industry is entering the traditional off-peak season, demand is likely to remain strong due to the 4Q13 performance. The utilization rate for major manufacturers in both Taiwan and China remains high, and their demand toward upstream raw material is still strong. It causes polysilicon market trade to stay active recently, with spot price rising continuously. 
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, it’s not possible for polysilicon price to increase substantially in the short run. Meanwhile, most of the manufacturers are optimistic about the overall PV market in 2014, projecting demand from Japan and China will continuously increase. Furthermore, with Western markets demanding more high-efficiency products, manufacturers have started to shift their focus toward this area. On the other hand, since the utilization rate for major manufacturers has almost or already reached 100%, many of them have initiated capacity expansion plans, which helped raise upstream raw material demand and pulled up the spot price. Because of these developments, polysilicon manufacturers have turned more stubborn toward the contractual price next year. 
EnergyTrend also noticed that auxiliary material supply for polysilicon manufacturers has started to decline. Thus, auxiliary material supply shortage may cause contractual price to increase next year. Yet, the increased range will have to depend on how buyers and sellers negotiate. Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, suppliers’ target price next year is above US$1.0/kg, while buyers hope to keep the price within US$0.5/kg. EnergyTrend believes buyers and sellers will not stop negotiating in the short run due to their different expectations on price. 
In addition to the strong market transactions which allowed manufacturers to revise the price upward, changes within Chinese policies also have large impact toward polysilicon market. According to EnergyTrend’s investigation, China will come up with stricter polysilicon import policies next year. Although China has announced polysilicon anti-dumping and countervailing policy and imposed heavy punitive tariffs on European and US imports this year, Western manufacturers have found loopholes in the government’s so-called “handbook” to avoid the punitive tariffs. As a result of the policies being rendered useless, Chinese polysilicon manufacturers have recently requested for stricter anti-dumping regulations. It’s projected that the Chinese government may cancel or limit the conditions listed in the “handbook” next January. However, based on the current Chinese polysilicon price, simply cancelling the handbook may raise polysilicon price once again and increase the production cost for downstream manufacturers. Hence, downstream manufacturers are getting ready to oppose it. Whether the stricter regulations will be put into practice next January remains to be seen.
Assuming the “handbook” is cancelled as expected, EnergyTrend believes that polysilicon market may come up with different scenarios:


		In order to maintain the market share in China, foreign manufacturers will revise the customs price downward to stay competitive in the Chinese market. Also, production cost may drop further for manufacturers outside of China.

		Foreign manufacturers  maintain basic price and passively lower supply in the Chinese market. The extra capacity may be used for semi-conductor raw material. They may even use legal means to request manufacturers outside of China to comply with relevant contracts. Yet, whether polysilicon price will decrease depends on the result of negotiation.

Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, since Chinese polysilicon price remains high and suppliers’ quotation continues to increase in December, this week’s price reflects an uptrend. For multi-si wafers, supply shortage remains for high-efficiency products. Also, Chinese manufacturers have revised the price upward, which causes spot price to continuously rise. For mono-si wafers, demand still reflects a downtrend with this week’s average price. For cells, full-production status remains for major manufacturers. Yet, certain manufacturers have chosen to lower the price. For modules, buyers have become more cautious. Moreover, module price in Japan continues to decline with this week’s average price. Affected by the decreased module price and weak thin-film demand, this week’s thin-film average price declined with a 0.64% drop.

                                PV Spot Price Slowly Increases with US$20/kg Being the Polysilicon Ceiling Price in the Short Run                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131225-5980.html,"

EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that the market is generally optimistic about the demand in 2014. But since subsidies have been cut significantly, the development for large-scale power plants is to be tested. Whether self-consumption segment can fill the gap in a short period of time has become critical to the continual market growth. “Supply adjustment will still be required in 2014 and the consolidation processes will also continue. Sales channels will be mostly handled by first-tier manufacturers and the impact on the spot market will be larger. Therefore, in 2014, the market will slowly grow, which will raise polysilicon price. But since China may cancel the government’s so-called “handbook”, US$20/kg may be the ceiling price for polysilicon manufacturers in the Short Run.

 “If calculating based on the average polysilicon price of US$20/kg, wafer cost will reach US$1/piece-US$1.1/piece and cell cost will be US$0.38/watt-US$0.39/watt. As for modules, the cost will fall between US$0.57/watt-US$0.66/watt,” Hsu added. Although silicon wafer manufacturers have successfully revised the wafer price upward in 4Q13, it didn’t reach break-even point. Thus, 2014 will be an important year for manufacturers to achieve break-even status. EnergyTrend believes both wafer and cell manufacturers will try to target on US$1/piece.
In terms of cells, current average sales price has allowed manufacturers to turn around losses. In 2014, major manufacturers may continuously gain profit. For modules, product sales price is greatly affected by individual market. Thus, profit status for manufacturers will be different based on the composition of company clients. It’s projected that market price in 1Q14 will fluctuate but it will start to increase in 2Q14. Overall, EnergyTrend believes relevant manufacturers can continue to be profitable due to the stable demand growth in 2014.

Aside from the increased market price, what needs to be paid attention to is the supply and demand status of mono-si market. As indicated by EnergyTrend’s 2014 outlook report, the development of large-scale power plants is to be tested due to the substantial subsidy cut. It in turn affects the demand for normal-grade products. On the other hand, self-consumption segment may grow further in the future. Mono-si wafer manufacturers have started to expand capacity since the second half of 2013 and have completed the expansion plans in 4Q13 continually.
As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation regarding the shipment for major cell manufacturers next year, the proportion of mono-si cells may represent more than 20%. Mono-si wafer demand will be about 9GW-13GW. Although mono-si wafer price has declined lately, EnergyTrend believes this is only temporarily caused by different supply and demand timing. If judging from the demand of 9GW-13GW in 2014, there may be slight supply shortage issue for mono-si wafer and price is likely to increase.
Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, average polysilicon price in China was close to RMB$140/kg. With suppliers turning tougher towards the spot price, last week’s price continued to increase. For multi-si wafers, first-tier manufacturers have revised relevant product price upward. Also, manufacturers kept raising the price because they have received quite a few orders already, which led to the increased spot price. Last week’s average price increased with  a 0.11% rise. For mono-si wafers, demand was still turning weak and last week’s average price had  a 0.09% drop. For cells and modules, the utilization rate for first-tier manufacturers remained high. There were no significant market change, thus, last week’s price remained flat.

                                Increased Roof-Top PV Market Penetration Rate May Affect Electricity Company Revenue                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20131228-5991.html,"


	 

	Impacted by the decreased PV system installation cost and Feed-in Tariff (FiT) as well as increased electricity price, roof-top system market continues to grow in Europe and USA. According to EnergyTrend’s investigation, the return rate of electricity cost saved from using self-consumption systems in certain regions has become much greater than that of large-scale projects. It shows that the penetration rate of self-consumption segment is increasing.

	 

	Since Europe and USA have cut down the subsidy for large-scale projects, project return rate has declined substantially, leaving challenges to large-scale power plants. As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, the return rate for large-scale projects is around 8%-12% in the German market. Fewer investors are willing to invest in these kinds of projects. On the other hand, due to the decreased FiT, investors have started to ask suppliers to revise the price downward so they can at least maintain the basic rate of return. Currently, module price has dropped below US$0.7/watt and Balance of System (BOS) cost has also declined, which causes system cost to be around US$3.0/watt. Although there are doubts on large-scale project development, roof-top market grows thanks to the decreased system cost and increased electricity price. For example, roof-top system market grew by 85%-90% in 2013 in California, USA.

	 

	Furthermore, the growth of roof-top systems may affect the revenue of traditional electricity companies. Based on former business model, traditional electricity companies purchase electricity generated from power plants and then re-sell it to the consumers in order to benefit all three parties. But the increased electricity price and the decreased FiT and power generation cost caused electricity cost saved from using self-consumption systems to be greater than revenues generated from FiT price. Hence, consumers are more willing to install roof-top PV systems. From the current trend, revenue for traditional electricity companies will be impacted. For example, electricity companies in Western Australia have proclaimed their electricity demand has declined. In another word, it can bring larger financial pressure to those who still use traditional electricity. With surcharge fees increasing, it will affect electricity price trend and indirectly create an unfair situation – those who still use traditional electricity will have to pay more electricity cost and grid-connection cost. 

	 

	Judging from the spot market’s overall performance, since Chinese polysilicon price remains high and suppliers’ January quotation continues to increase, this week’s price reflects an uptrend, with average price reaching US$17.883/kg, a 2.1% rise. For multi-si wafers, supply shortage remains for high-efficiency products. Also, manufacturers have revised the price upward, which causes spot price to continuously rise. This week’s average price comes to US$0.921/piece, a 0.66% rise. For mono-si wafers, this week’s average price declines to US$1.148/piece, a 0.95% drop. For cells, market demand and utilization rate remain high. However, due to the increased wafer price and decreased module price, market price still fluctuates. This week’s average price comes to US$0.388/watt, a 0.26% drop. For modules and inverters, this week’s price decreases for both, with module average price reaching US$0.661/watt, a 1.2% drop and inverter average price reaching US$0.194/watt, a 2.51% drop.

EnergyTrend indicates that cell manufacturers may revise the price upward to correspond to the increased poly and multi-si wafer price. Recent targeted average price is US$0.4/watt.
“After poly price slightly declined in 2Q13, it started to go upward in 2H13. In fact, ever since poly price dropped to US$16.32/kg in July, it never got worse than US$16.4/kg. Poly price in 4Q13 reached US$17.0/kg and average spot price in the end of 2013 even approached US$18.0/kg. Judging from the average monthly price, poly spot price rose by 7.2% in 2H13. Average price came to US$17.5/kg in December, 2013 while that in January, 2014 will be US$19.0-20.0/kg,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
Poly Price Trend from July to December, 2013








					 



On the other hand, since poly price in 4Q13 was already US$17.0/kg and multi-si wafer demand continued to increase, major manufacturers can fully utilize production line and allow price to be revised upward. Furthermore, there are supply shortage issues for high-efficiency multi-si wafers. As indicated by EnergyTrend’s investigation, most Taiwanese manufacturers have started to look for outsourcing opportunities in December, 2013 in order to fulfill the large demand. After going through a preparation period, wafer manufacturers have also made price adjustment in 4Q13. Average price in January, 2014 is projected to be US$0.98-1.02/piece.
Multi-Si Wafer Price Trend from July to December, 2013








					 



As indicated by EnergyTrend’s data, multi-si wafer price increased by 4.2% in 2H13, which brought certain pressure to cell manufacturers’ cost. Gross margin for module manufacturers was about 10%. Relevant manufacturers believe clients can still handle the rising cost pressure. It’s a must to revise the price upward. Thus, major manufacturers are planning to increase prices by US$0.01/watt, while other manufacturers will target a US$0.005/watt increase.
Cell Price Trend from July to December, 2013

Judging from the spot market, overall market condition is suitable for price to be adjusted upward. EnergyTrend believes the price from poly to cell will continue to increase in the short run, but the increased range may be different. For poly, Chinese poly price remains high and that in January, 2014 may reach RMB$145/kg. Demand in other regions is also strong, which raises the price simultaneously. This week’s average price comes to US$18.498/kg, a 3.4% rise. For multi-si wafers, supply shortage remains for high-efficiency products. Also, manufacturers have revised the price upward, which causes spot price to continuously rise. This week’s average price reaches US$0.954/piece, a 3.58% rise. For mono-si wafers, this week’s average price is raised to US$1.154/piece, a 0.52% rise. For cells, market demand and utilization rate remain high. Raw material cost significantly increases, thus manufacturers slightly revise cell price upward to test clients’ reaction. This week’s average price comes to US$0.389/watt, a 0.26% rise. For modules, average price is still showing a sight downtrend. Yet, recent price is more stable. It’s projected that price will remain the same or slightly increase in the short run, with this week’s average price being US$0.66/watt, a 0.15% drop.

EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that since high-efficiency wafer supply shortage remains and demand is still strong, both buyers and sellers have started to plan for February orders ahead of time. It’s projected that wafer price can reach US$1.0/piece in February. By then, Taiwanese manufacturers can be breakeven, and even turn around losses.
“Taiwanese wafer manufacturers have achieved full-production status currently. However, they still can’t satisfy the large incoming demand and thus delay all the lead time. Relevant manufacturers have been searching for outsourcing opportunities aggressively so they can get through all the orders. On the other hand, January wafer price have been revised upward continuously. Current data shows that wafer price for Taiwanese manufacturers has reached US$1.01-1.05/piece, which increased US$0.03-0.05/piece, a 3.1%-5.1% rise in contrast to December price,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
The number of orders received in December and January turned out to be more than expected, which caused lead time to delay and in turn impacted clients’ subsequent production. In order to avoid the same thing happen again, certain manufacturers have begun to negotiate for February production schedule. Furthermore, wafer price for Taiwanese manufacturers continues to increase due to the serious supply shortage issue for high-efficiency products. Major Chinese manufacturers’ wafer price also approaches US$1.0/piece and lead to the increased wafer price trend. “Although February quotation is US$1.05/piece, it may end up at US$1.0/piece and above. Judging from Taiwanese manufacturers’ current production cost, the price will allow them to be breakeven or turn loss into profit,” added Hsu.
From spot market perspective, overall market condition is in good shape. EnergyTrend believes price from poly to cell will reflect an uptrend in January but the increased range will vary.
For poly, Chinese poly price remains high, reaching RMB150/kg in January. Yet, actual trading price is still around RMB140/kg. Moreover, poly manufacturers are rather conservative about placing orders in case there will be too much inventory. This week’s poly price comes to US$18.498/kg, which is steady like last week’s.
For multi-si wafers, supply shortage remains for high-efficiency products. Also, manufacturers have revised the price upward, which causes spot price to continuously rise. This week’s average price comes to US$0.97/piece, a 1.68% rise. As for mono-si wafers, this week’s average price slightly raises to US$1.163/piece, a 0.78% rise.
For cells, market demand and utilization rate remain high in January. While Taiwanese manufacutrers continue to revise the price upward, Chinese manufacturers’ price is stable. Thus, this week’s average price reaches US$0.39/watt, a 0.26% rise.
For modules, Chinese manufacturers’ price is more stable, with this week’s average price remaining at US$0.66/watt. However, price may increase in the short run due to the increased raw material cost and new policies released by the Chinese government.

SolarWorld once again requested anti-dumping and countervailing investigation against Chinese modules shipped to USA. This time, the investigation will include module with third-party solar cells. EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that the total amount of PV installation was 4.3GW in 2013, in which 90% (around 3GW) of modules were from China. Although it cost US$0.7/watt for Chinese modules shipped to USA, the cost was very close to the minimum price set between EU-China. However, due to the Chinese government’s great support towards the PV industry these years, Chinese manufacturers can sell relatively low-priced products as they are under deficit . It’s projected that US has a moderate chance of establishing the case.
“Although the Taiwanese government didn’t provide PV subsidy plans (e.g. financial support, tax incentive, and export tax rebate) and Taiwanese manufacturers’ average cell price was between US$0.39-0.41/watt, Taiwanese cell manufacturers still turned around losses in 3Q13 due to the increased cell price. Yet, judging from previous experiences, such as DRAM, steel, and textile industry, the criterion for product dumping has to depend on whether manufacturers’ sales price is lower than the cost. Basically, by definition, Taiwanese manufacturers’ sales practices meet that criterion of USA’s anti-dumping. Hence, the government agencies and the industry should respond quickly and start collecting and analyzing relevant data based on SolarWorld’s request. Through searching for conditions favorable to Taiwan in the future investigation, Taiwan’s PV industry rights and future development can be maintained,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.








					 



Judging from the spot market, although the market is uncertain due to USA’s anti-dumping and countervailing investigation, they are still positive about the overall market condition. EnergyTrend believes that the price from poly to cell will continue to increase in the short run in January. For poly, Chinese poly price remains high. The quotation may reach RMB$150/kg in January while actual price may be around RMB$143/kg. This week’s average price comes to US$18.768/kg, a 1.46% rise. For multi-si wafers, supply shortage issue remains for high-efficiency products. Manufacturers have also revised the price upward, which causes spot price to continuously increase. This week’s average price reaches US$0.979/piece, a 0.93% rise. For mono-si wafers, this week’s average price is raised to US$1.165/piece, a 0.17% rise. For cells, market demand and utilization rate remain high in January. Anti-dumping and countervailing investigation proposed by USA didn’t impact cell price to go up again in January, with average price reaching US$0.393/watt, a 0.77% rise. For modules, this week’s average price is US$0.66/watt, staying flat from last week. However, EnergyTrend estimates that price trend in the short run will fluctuate due to USA’s anti-dumping investigation.

EnergyTrend indicates that orders haven’t been cut substantially after China-USA solar trade war took place. ITC estimates to announce the result by the end of February. If the case is established, the US Department of Commerce (DoC) will continue to investigate regarding subsidy and product dumping. EnergyTrend projects that it’s not going to affect Taiwanese manufacturers until this March.
“Currently, full-production status remains for Taiwan’s wafer manufacturers. Instead of losing orders due to USA’s anti-dumping and countervailing action, there are more orders lined up in February. As for March market forecast, evaluation can’t be made until things become clearer after the Chinese Lunar New Year. In terms of cell manufacturers, production will still be fully-utilized in February, with certain manufacturers revising the price upward. But less working days in February may lead to sales revenue drop,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
In February, high-efficiency wafer price will continue to increase. The quotes for major manufacturers have exceeded US$1.0/piece while current price is between US$1.03-1.05/piece. For cells, price for high-efficiency products will also increase. The quotes for first-tier manufacturers have come to US$0.41-0.42/watt while the rest of manufacturers remained at US$0.4/watt. 
Judging from last week’s spot market, Chinese manufacturers’ utilization rate has started to drop because operators continually went home to celebrate Chinese Lunar New Year. Yet, both Taiwanese and Chinese Manufacturers remained optimistic about the overall market condition after New Year. EnergyTrend projects that price in February will reflect an uptrend. But price may fluctuate in the end of February since ITC will announce the result for anti-dumping and countervailing investigation by then.
For poly, Chinese poly price remained high. The quotation in February may reach RMB154/kg while actual price may be around RMB145/kg. However, most manufacturers have filled up their inventory as it approaches the New Year, thus recent trading volume has begun to decrease. Impacted by the increased Chinese poly price, last week’s average price came to US$19.207/kg, a 2.34% rise.
For multi-si wafers, supply shortage issue for high-efficiency products will go on in February. Manufacturers have continued to revise the price upward, which caused spot price to increase as well.  Last week’s average price reached US$0.989/piece, a 1.02% rise. As for mono-si wafers, last week’s average price slowly increased to US$1.166/piece, a 0.09% rise. 
For cells, there will be no changes toward February demand and utilization rate will still be high. While Chinese manufacturers’ price remained steady, Taiwanese manufacturers will revise the price upward slightly. Last week’s average price came to US$0.396/watt, a 0.76% rise.
For modules, since the result for anti-dumping and countervailing investigation hasn’t been finalized and utilization rate for Chinese manufacturers has continued to drop due to the Chinese New Year, last week’s price remained at US$0.66/watt.

	EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that although the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) proclaimed that Europe’s solar-grade poly imports counted as “product dumping” and it caused substantial damages to Chinese poly industry, the Chinese government decided not to impose anti-dumping tariff on European poly imports. EnergyTrend believes that this will help European manufacturers to maintain their market share in the Chinese market in 2014. It can also give pressures to the ongoing USA-China trade war.

	 

	EnergyTrend’s data indicates that Chinese poly imports were 81 thousand tons, among which, Germany, USA, and Korea totaled 70 thousand tons, representing 87% of China’s total poly imports in 2013 (Germany – 32%, USA – 28%, and Korea – 27%). Apart from the three countries, other countries, such as Taiwan, Japan, and Norway, represented 8%, 4%, and 1%, respectively, of China’s total poly imports in 2013. The rest of the regions represented less than 1%.

	 



	 

	“Taiwan usually exports poly to China in the form of a spot trade, with supply mostly coming from long-term contracted manufacturers. Wacker (Germany) and OCI (Korea) are the major manufacturers that currently run contracts in Taiwan. Therefore, Korean and German poly imports account for about 65%-67% of China’s total imports,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.

	 

	Aside from the US, the average price for other major import regions is above US$18.5/kg. Yet, the average price for US imported products is only US$13.83/kg, a 35%-70% price difference compare to other regions. On the other hand, based on the final anti-dumping and countervailing result announced by China, punitive tariffs of 55.4%-59.1% were imposed on US manufacturers. In which, punitive tariffs of 55.4% were imposed on one of the major manufacturers, Hemlock. In the short term, USA, Korea, and Germany are still the major countries for poly imports. From long-term perspective, the anti-dumping and countervailing tariff will not be imposed on European manufacturers for now since US manufacturers face punitive taxes of more than 50% while Korean manufacturers face only 2.4%. EnergyTrend believes that this will help European manufacturers to maintain their market share in the Chinese market in 2014. It can also give pressures to the ongoing USA-China trade war.

	 



	 

	Judging from this week’s spot market, since the Chinese Lunar New Year just ended and ITC planned to announce the investigation result by Feb 14th, both Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers have started to map out all kinds of possibilities, hence leading to conservative market trade.

	For poly, demand from China remains strong. Although there are uncertainties caused by USA-China trade war, trade in the Chinese market continues. Current average price is above RMB150/kg. This week’s average poly price reflects an uptrend, with price reaching US$19.745/kg, a 1.54% rise.

	 

	For inverters, investors usually request a certain rate of return (IRR), thus inverter manufacutrers’ price continues to decline as subsidy rate keeps dropping. This week’s average price reaches US$0.187/watt, a 3.61% drop.

	For wafers, cells, and modules, this week’s price remains steady.

                                US-China Trade War and the End of Japan’s Fiscal Year Lead to Taiwanese Manufacturers’ Low Sales Revenue in March                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140217-6201.html,"

Taiwanese manufacturers hold conservative attitudes toward shipments after Chinese Lunar New Year due to the US-China trade war and the end of fiscal year in Japan. However, according to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, major Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers still maintain regular shipment while some of them even accelerate shipments to the US and Japan. Thus, sales revenue can still be high in February. It’s projected that the US-China trade war’s impact on Taiwanese manufacutrers won’t begin to show until March.
EnergyTrend’s data indicates that major manufacturers, such as Trina Solar, Yingli, Renesola, Canadian Solar, and Jinko Solar, have placed 60MW-90MW of orders from Taiwanese manufacturers. “Bargaining process was completed for 80% of February orders in January and none of the orders have been cancelled. It somehow accelerate shipments to the US and Japan in February. In addition, the total orders received exceed 110MW for just two manufacturers in Northern Taiwan in February,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
Although more orders have been placed in February, price may be revised downward. “Clients have requested cell and wafer manufacturers to reduce cost, with range being 3%-5%. Since bargaining process has been completed for most February orders, production utilization rate also increased. While manufacturers accelerate shipments to the US and Japan in February, shipments to these regions is projected to decline in March due to the US-China trade war and the end of fiscal year in Japan,” added Hsu.
In terms of this week’s spot market, buyers and sellers have different opinions regarding future price. Buyers have started to request for cost-down, meanwhile, sellers act as if they didn’t hear buyers’ request. On the other hand, the status for US-China trade war won’t be clear until mid-February or even mid-June. Therefore, manufacturers are conservative about orders in March, and hence lead to recent price stagnation.
This week’s poly, module, and cell price remain steady. For multi-si wafers, because clients have placed more orders in February, certain buyers have accepted the new February quotation while sellers insist to keep the price unchanged. This week’s average price comes to US$1.014/piece, a 0.8% rise. For mono-si wafers, price still fluctuates and demand slightly increases, with this week’s average price reaching US$1.171/piece, a 0.09% rise.

                                Price Quotations of Upstream PV Products to Rise Despite Complicated Market Factors in March                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140224-6250.html,"


	Last week, there were two headlines for solar industry on both positive and negative sides – the positive one was that China officially announced its new PV system installation target of 14GW in 2014, which represented a strong market demand; the negative one was that the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) had filed SolarWorld’s petition against dumping and subsidies. EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that spot prices of upstream PV products will continue to rise in spite of the complicated market conditions and disadvantageous factors in the U.S. market.

	 

	According to EnergyTrend, Taiwanese wafer price will increase by around 5% to US $1.1/piece in March. Regarding polycrystalline silicon, the quotation may increase by 6% ~ 8% from February to RMB 170/kg in March because the price in the Chinese market remains high, and it hence leads to the increased global price. “Although there seems to be an uncertain factor in the U.S. market, the global supply-demand situation is still intense. The outlook toward China, Europe, Japan and emerging markets is positive as well,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend. “Additionally, as raw material price is expected to become higher, several markets offer manufacturers advantageous conditions to raise the price in March.”

	 

	Recently, Taiwanese PV cell makers have been striving to come up with the best strategy for dumping lawsuit and to minimize the possible loss. Despite the fact that the spot price may increase in March, buyers are likely to act in a more conservative way during this period. It takes time for China’s advantageous policies to carry on and bring actual results, adding the fact that situations in the U.S. and Japanese markets won’t be clear until mid- to late-March. EnergyTrend therefore predicts that the prices of Taiwanese PV products may slightly increase while the shipment may slightly drop in March.

	 

	Last week, March’s quotation of polycrystalline silicon increased but trading price remained as usual. The average price in the Chinese market was around RMB 155/kg and the price in the Taiwanese market slightly rose by 0.56% to US $19.856/kg during the same period.

	 

	Regarding prices of polycrystalline silicon wafers, the trading prices in the Chinese market kept rising because of strong domestic demand and high capacity utilization in February. Trading prices in Taiwan increased by 2.96% to US $1.044/piece last week as Taiwanese manufacturers had already started negotiating orders for March and some orders have been bargained by higher prices. Monocrystalline wafer price also increased by 2.05% to US $1.195/piece, which was  triggered by stronger demand from the Chinese market.
	 

	Rising quotation of mono-Si cells caused the average price to rise slightly to US $0.397/Watt, a 0.25% rise. Price of mono-si modules also rose a bit while price of poly-si modules remained the same last week.

	March 2014 spot price will be nearly the same as February, and some manufacturers will undergo incremental price increase, said EnergyTrend, a green energy subsidiary of TrendForce last week. PV volume will also be similar to Feb. 2014 levels. Generally speaking, the trend in March is quite close to EnergyTrend’s earlier projection of a slight price hike in the PV industry and decreasing volumess.

	 

	Polycrystalline silicon’s price quotes continued to rise in March. At the moment, the PV market believes that price will remain high in the short-term resulting in investors’ reluctance to sell out. In addition, manufacturers’ poly-si purchase costs also became higher. Last week poly-Si prices increased 0.77% to US $20.009/kg, surpassing the threshold of US $20/kg.

	 

	Regarding polycrystalline wafer prices, manufacturers raised March price quotes to support  operations because of China’s stronger domestic demands and higher poly-Si price, which led to higher wafer costs. Furthermore, buyers and sellers have sealed orders, which led to spot price increase of 0.48% to US $1.049/piece last week. Meanwhile, prices of mono-Si wafers remained flat that week.

	 

	PV cells demand also remained strong last week. Chinese manufacturers’ price quotes remained the same, while Taiwanese manufacturers cell prices rose slightly by 0.25% to US $0.398/watt. In addition, prices for PV modules were kept at the same levels.

                                Policies and Incentives Boost Australia’s Large-Scale Power Plant Demand                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140308-6326.html,"

The renewable energy market rapidly grows in Australia due to the recent policies and incentives. However, the economic recession and the decreased system price caused the Australian government to revise the subsidy rate downward. EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that the subsidy was revised downward in the top-two roof-top system markets, Queensland (QLD) and Victoria (VIC) in 2012; the subsidy was suspended in Western Australia (WA) and New South Wales (NSW); net metering was adopted by Northern Territory (NT), Capital Region (ACT), and Tasmania (TAS).
Although the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) has been completed ahead of time, the importance of the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) has started to increase. Affected by polices related to carbon reduction (such as carbon tax imposition or direct incentive scheme that’s being arranged) and the decreased system price, large power companies have begun to invest in renewable energy plants. Combining the role of buyers and system integrators, conventional power companies focus more on self-built renewable energy plants nowadays.
On the other hand, Australia’s central government has held, in succession, the international tenders for large-scale PV plants since 2013. The scale is up to 210MW to attract more companies participate in the bid. How large power companies can set up the minimum electricity price themselves can also benefit to the market growth. For example, ActewAGL, a power company, has released 40MW of capacity and it were Spanish, Chinese, and Australian manufacturers that won the bid, with average electricity price being about $183/MWh. To investors, manufacturers with stable return rates and lower investment risks, like the ones mentioned above, will tempt more people to invest in Australia’s large-scale power plants.
There are not many changes to this week’s spot market. Price in March remains steady and demand from March to May can be accurately forecasted at this point. But demand in June is still unclear because the US’ initial judgment regarding anti-dumping won’t be announced until the beginning of June.
This week’s poly, multi-si wafer, and module price all remain stable. Only mono-si wafer price slightly rises due to the increased demand. This week’s average price reaches $1.206/piece, a 0.92% rise.

	The US Department of Commerce announced on March, 11th that the anti-subsidy initial judgment for certain Chinese crystalline silicon PV products will be extended from March, 28th to June, 2nd. EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, indicates that the delay will stimulate PV market demand and in turn boost the price. 
“Current market supply and demand is in good shape. Demand from March to May is rather stable. Also, June demand forecast has started to show after the US announced the delay. Manufacturers, such as Trina, Yingli, Renesola, and CSI have aggressively placed orders and sold the products to the US market,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
On the other hand, according to EnergyTrend’s investigation, price trend in 2Q14 will remain steady. Poly price will be around US$23/kg (ASP); high-efficiency wafer price is between US$1.05-1.07/piece (ASP) while normal-grade is about US$1.0/piece (ASP); for cell, Taiwanese manufacturers’ high-efficiency cell price will remain at US$0.41-0.42/watt (ASP), which shows that Q2 price may be flat. Market price is likely to increase further due to the delay on the anti-subsidy initial judgment. In addition, more demand may come from North America in Q2, and the demand in Japan and Europe will be recoverd too. Hence, manufacturers’ utilization rate will increase and in turn raise the price. EnergyTrend predicts  that poly price will be US$25/kg in Q2 and high-efficiency wafer price will be US$1.1/piece. As for Taiwan’s high-efficiency solar cell, price could exceed US$0.42/watt.
In terms of spot market, recent demand is still high, with March price being steady. However, due to the less demand in Japan in March, first-tier module manufacturers’ utilization rate will be stable, but second/third-tier ones’will decrease.
Poly price in Taiwan started to increase, with last week’s average price reaching US$20.175/kg, a 0.83% rise. For multi-si wafer, Taiwanese manufacturers have raised the price while Chinese manufacturers revised the price downward slightly. Last week’s average price came to US$1.058/piece, a 0.86% rise.

                                Japan’s Lowered PV Feed-in Tariff May Cause ROI Decrease 3-5%                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140324-6408.html,"


	Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced it will lower PV Feed-in Tariff (FiT) in fiscal year 2014. For PV systems with capacity of 10kW and above, commercial PV FiT will be revised down from 36 yen per kW (tax-excluded) to 32 yen, while residential FiT is to be dropped from 38 yen to 37 yen.

	 

	“Due to the PV FiT revisions, the Return Of Investment (ROI) is decreasing for large Japanese power plants,” said Arthur Hsu, Research Manager of EnergyTrend. “ROI for large PV power plants in 2014 will be 8-12%, a decrease of 3-5% compared to last year.” 

	 

	""Hsu’s analysis is based on the conditions of lower module and cells prices than before, but same level of construction, land and funding costs. The calculations also takes into account impact from higher consumption taxes; spot prices; sunlight conditions; and power plant locations.

	 

	""The possibility of low ROI (less than 10%) for PV system might impact sales of some power plants, hence system manufacturers will want to reduce costs. However, as module prices in Japan hit an all-time low there is limited room for further price cuts. Nonetheless, module manufacturers’ capacity expansions may start driving module prices down in 2H14 and system prices may consequently drop. Under this scenario, ROI of power plants is likely to rebound.

	 

This Week’s Price Quotes

	 

	This week Taiwanese manufacturers purchase poly-Si at a relatively high price of US$ 20.489/kg, an increase of 1.56% from last week. This is because of stable spot prices and poly-Si supply shortages. Price quotes from Taiwan-made wafers, cells and modules have been revised downward, due to lower prices quotations from Chinese manufacturers. Wafer prices decreased 0.57% to US$1.052/piece, while price of cells dropped 0.75% to US$0.395/watt compared to last week. Additionally, module prices dropped 4.7% to US$0.629/watt.

Recent changes in spot market trends have led to substantial decline in PV products trading prices. Price quotes for polysilicon to modules dropped around 1%-3%, noted EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce. Whether demand fluctuations at the end of March implies weaker 2Q14 demands still remains to be seen.
Wafer prices fluctuated the most, with quotes decreasing significantly, according to EnergyTrend’s supply chain survey. Relevant data showed that the quotes of high-efficiency multi-si wafer declined from US$1.05-1.07/piece at the beginning of March to US$1.03-1.04/piece recently, a 1.87%-2.86% drop. For normal-grade products, the quotation also declined from US$1.0-1.02/piece to US$0.99-1.01/piece, a 1%-2.94% drop. Manufacturers stated that there are still some uncertainties in the market, and manufacturers face quote pressures. 
“The decreased wafer price might be due to the pre-load at the end of 1Q14 and decreased demand,” said Arthur Hsu, Research Manager of EnergyTrend. “Based on EnergyTrend’s investigation, China’s demand has reflected a downtrend towards the end of March. With the exception of first-tier manufacturers, other manufacturers’ utilization rates have declined substantially. This is one of the main reasons as to why China’s spot price was the first to reflect upon it. In addition, declined demands in China caused wafer manufacturers to continue to increase shipments to Taiwan, which has put pressure on Taiwanese manufacturers and led to falling market prices.” 
In terms of the spot market, easing Chinese market demands towards the end of March is adding stress on second-tier and under manufacturers. Therefore, these manufacturers have lowered quotations in exchange for more shipment opportunities. However, manufacturers indicated China’s EPC manufacturers have begun to place orders for April, and projected demands would increase next month, which in turn might drive up price quotes.

Manufacturers are likely to be moreconservative when placing orders as demands from China started to decline at the end of March. Whether market demand willincrease later on still remains to be seen.

	 

	“Price fluctuation this time was caused by decreased Chinese demand,” said Arthur Hsu, Research Manager of EnergyTrend. ”Major Chinese manufacturers’ high-efficiency products price quotes came to RMB6.5-6.8/piece. Price quotes for first-tier manufacturers have dropped to RMB7.0/piece, which affected Chinese manufacturers’ overseas quotation.” Based on EnergyTrend’s price investigation, Chinese manufacturers’ quotation has declined to US$1.03-1.02/piece while Taiwanese manufacturers still floated around US$ 1.05-1.03/piece. Thus, Taiwanese manufacturers have been asked to reduce price by clients.

	 

	On the other hand, Chinese manufacturers’ plans to increase shipments to Taiwan is another reason why prices fluctuated. “GCL increased shipments to Taiwan the most. In fact, their target is to increase from 32 million pieces each month in Q1 to 50 million pieces each month in Q2. Their major competitors’ shipments to Taiwan will remain at 35 million pieces per month. Prices will be cut down from high levels in 1Q14 to sell out the extra 18 million pieces shipped to Taiwan since March,” added Hsu.

Recent changes in the PV market have led to China’s waning demands at the end of March 2014, while further observations are required for orders in April this year. These have led to lowered price quotes for relevant products. In other words, although there were few changes in April and May orders, price quotes have fallen. Thus, manufacturers are still conservative about price trends in Q2, analyzed EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce.
Polysilicon contract prices continued to decline in April 2014. In fact, contract prices dropped to US$ 21-22/kg after hitting US$23/kg in March. “Due to growing mono-si wafer demands , manufacturers have started to focus on high-quality polysilicon in April, which led to decreased demands for normal-grade polysilicon that was previously in high demands,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend. “Meanwhile, auxiliary material demand has declined leading to improved supply and demands situation since manufacturers now focus on high-efficiency products and mono-si products. Based on current prices, the price difference between auxiliary material and normal products is about 15%.”
In addition, polysilicon contract price declined for two consecutive months, which also affected spot price trend. “Certain price quotes have dipped around 0.5%-1%. Looking into the price trend in Q2, polysilicon spot price will be further lowered and contract price will continue to decline slightly. Furthermore, policy changes and increased market uncertainties might cause wafer, cell, and module prices to decline as well,” added Hsu.

Impacted by recent market demand changes and narrowing price gaps, mono-si cell demand may increase in 2Q14, analyzed EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce. In regards to spot market, there is limited room for further price increases as further observations are required for supply and demand condition in 2Q. Thus, recent spot prices will continue to fluctuate.
The competitiveness of mono-si cell significantly increased, due to mono-si and multi-si cell’s reduced price gaps and existing efficiency difference advantage. “Current Chinese mono-si cell’s conversion efficiency is around 18.4%, while Taiwanese multi-si cell’s is between 17.4%-17.6%. Usually, cells with conversion efficiency above 17.6% are expensive high-efficiency products with lower production output,” said Arthur Hsu, Research Manager of EnergyTrend. “Chinese mono-si cell’s price quotes is US$0.41-0.43/watt. Meanwhile, quotation of Taiwanese high-efficiency multi-si cell is almost the same as Chinese manufacturers, with conversion efficiency absolute value gap being about 1%. From users’ perspectives, clients are more willing to use mono-si cell because mono-si has higher power output under the same price conditions.”
In addition, market change is another factor that led to increased mono-si cell demand. Supported by PV policies, distributed PV market has started to grow. Also, as PV leasing market expands, distributed PV clients’ major concern is still efficiency. Hence, they can accept higher prices compared to clients that installed ground-mounted systems. On the other hand, mono-si cell is more visually aesthetic because of its color consistent patterns. Therefore, for distributed PV clients, mono-si cell is the top choice in terms of price, efficiency and aesthetics.

PV stock clearance is nearly ending. Industry demands continued to increase in April and May this year, but orders for June 2014 remain uncertain. Thus, the spot market is still observing supply and demand changes in 2Q14. Meanwhile, a previous wave of marked down prices and unclear policies in certain markets has led to a beneficial supply and demand situation for buyers. Slower than anticipated stock clearance rates and wafer manufacturers’ high utilization rates led to large price fluctuations within the multi-si wafer market, analyzed EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce.
Market demand was strong in 1Q14 and cell orders surpassed expectations. Impacted by supply shortages, manufacturers made emergency procurements several times during January to February 2014, which caused material costs to increase significantly. To prevent the same situation from happening again, manufacturers March wafer stockup obviously increased. However, downstream cell and module manufacturers’ shipments declined because US-China anti-dumping and countervailing issue remained unclear, which slowed down wafer stock clearance. Therefore, multi-si wafer prices continued to decrease at the end of March, due to rising material stockup and easing stock clearance.
On the other hand, pricing strategy is another factor affecting the recent price trend. Manufacturers have adopted different pricing strategies to cope with substantial decline in PV demand. According to EnergyTrend’s investigation, leading manufacturers to use “cost-down” strategy in the market to attract buyers. Leading manufacturers have cut prices by 5% since late March 2014 till recent, which forced competitors to follow suit. In addition, smaller manufacturers have not rapidly expanded production capacity amidst the recent wafer demand rebound, instead these companies have raised the proportion of contract sales. Hence, prices have been stable as market demands drops, and companies have not lowered prices under production capacity and inventory pressure.

DuPont announced the termination of their silicon thin-film operations by the end of 2014 with gradual shut down the silicon thin-film production lines at their subsidiary company. Silicon thin-film market share is likely to keep falling in the short run, according to the analysis of EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce.
“Judging from recent price quotes, silicon thin-film price quotes is at US$0.58/watt while silicon module is at US$0.6/watt. Price difference has decreased from the original US$0.1/watt to US$0.02/watt. Therefore, silicon thin-film product no longer holds price competitiveness,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend. “Meanwhile, silicon module conversion efficiency is around 17.2% while silicon thin-film remains at 8% to 10%. Efficiency gap between the two will continue to increase as silicon module efficiency goes up.”
Another reason leading to the closing of silicon thin-film operations is the halting of new technology development by equipment manufacturers. In fact, relevant manufacturers were hoping to rely on Tandem technology’s commercialization to improve silicon thin-film product efficiency. However, after acquiring Oerlikon’s thin-film business, Tokyo Electron has ended Tandem technology development, which crushed thin-film manufacturers’ final hope.

                                Wacker Benefits From EU-China Polysilicon Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Issues                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140508-6695.html,"

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced on April 30, 2014, that they will impose anti-dumping and anti-subsidy taxes on European solar-grade polysilicon imports. Since China has signed a price agreement with Germany-based Wacker Chemie, the company will not be charged anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs within the two-year contract period.
Although Wacker didn’t make their compromised prices public, based on an analysis of the contract content, EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, estimates that the agreed CIF prices will fall between RMB$145-155/kg (approximately US$23.4-25/kg). As for OCI, Wacker’s biggest Korean competitor, the price quotes is around US$23/kg and rumors has it that it will be increase further.
According to Wacker’s 1Q14 financial results, polysilicon generated € 262 million in revenue, which increased 4.9% quarterly and 11.3% annually. Production was fully-utilized in 1Q, with solar-grade polysilicon prices and demand rising significantly. Based on current order situation, demand in 2Q still reflects an uptrend. It is projected that full-production status will remain in 2Q as well. “The competition is now very intense between OCI and Wacker as they are competing over China’s market shares. If Wacker’s agreed prices with China do fall within the range mentioned above, they can maintain their high competitiveness in the Chinese market,” says Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
This Week’s Market Price Quotes
As for the spot market, demand in April and May continues to increase. In addition, there are rumors that US-China anti-dumping and countervailing initial judgment may be postponed to July. Thus, orders in the beginning of June are being released, while, those in the end of June remains unclear.
Impacted by rumor of contract price increases, this week’s polysilicon price slightly increased 0.16% to US$20.357/kg. Leading multi-si wafer manufacturers’ prices have turned stable and hence led to increased quotation. This week’s prices reached US$1.006/piece, a 0.2% rise. Mono-si wafer price slightly dropped 0.17% to US$1.204/piece. Cell and module price quotes briefly declined to US$0.381/watt and US$0.618/watt, respectively, due to decreased normal-grade product prices.

                                Stronger Market Demand May Sustain PV Silicon Wafer’s Prices in 2Q                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140515-6739.html,"

Market demands to PV silicon wafers may remain stable as many manufacturers have reported growing monthly revenues. Meanwhile, demands also increased because of the postponement of US DoC’s initial verdict for anti-dumping duties. Stronger Chinese maker shipments, high shipment volume in the Japanese market, and improved economy condition in Europe are also helpful to the PV silicon wafer prices in the second quarter.
“Quotations for polysilicon wafers will remain around US$1.0/piece as efficiency of PV cells made by Chinese manufacturers improves,” says Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend. “They may upgrade the cell efficiency to 17.6% and make it the mainstream standard.” Therefore, the high efficiency poly-silicon wafer’s price would remain above US$1.0/piece. He also added that the price may continue to increase as long as the demands to rooftop PV system are better than anticipated in the 2H 2014. However, the price is not likely to exceed US$1.05/piece.
Mono-silicon wafer’s quote, which would fall between US$1.2/piece and US$1.25/piece, remains almost the same in the 2Q because of the relatively simple supply and demand situation. Nonetheless, shipment of mono-silicon cells would affect mono-silicon wafer’s price trends down the road. At the moment, the 2014 projection is that mono-silicon cells will take up 15% to 20% of the total market share of cells with the majority of the shipments concentrated in the 2H 2014. Arthur Hsu presents two scenarios: first, when mono-silicon cells’ shipment represents more than 20% of the total cell shipment, there will be a supply shortage of mono-silicon wafer and may drive the price to above US$1.25/piece. On the contrary, if the mono-silicon cells’ shipment shares less than 15% of the total shipment, the price might stay at around US$1.2/piece due to sufficient supply.
In addition, demands to normal-grade products would remain unchanged due to greater demands from Chinese and Japanese manufacturers and increasing needs from emerging markets. Cell manufacturers are also improving cell efficiency to reduce the demand for wafer’s quality, and this helps to maintain normal-grade products’ prices between US$0.95/piece and US$1.0/piece, estimated EnergyTrend.

This week, poly-silicon wafer’s price slightly decreased by 0.1% to US$1.005/piece. Meanwhile, PV cells’ price decreased by 0.59% to US$0.379/watt as a result of:  1) stock clearance of cells with 17.4% efficiency due to transition period of cell products and 2) psychological anticipation from the US-China solar trade war, which speeds up Chinese manufacturer’s shipment delivery to the U.S..

	High-performance products stand an important position at SNEC 2014. Adding the fact that cell manufacturers have started to implement high-efficiency production processes, mono-si wafer demand therefore become stronger. EnergyTrend observes that many PV manufacturers plan to expand their capacities to solve mono-si supply shortage issues.

	 

	Xi’an LonGi, Zhonghuan Huanou, Comtec Solar Systems, JingLong, and Solargiga Energy are currently the main providers of solar-grade mono-si wafers. According to EnergyTrend’s interviews conducted at SNEC 2014 with related manufacturers, mono-si still faces supply shortages compared with mono-si. A mono-si supplier said it is difficult to completely satisfy stronger demands from buyers even the production of mono-si is at full capacity. As a result, manufacturers like Xi’an LonGi and Zhonghuan Huanou will expand their mono-si capacities to 3GW by the end of 2014; moreover, both manufacturers plans to further expand 1GW in 2015 to reach a capacity of 5GW by 2016. Still, Solargiga, Comtec, and JingLong will remain their capacities.

	 

	In spite of expanding capacities, manufacturers continually try to reduce the production costs. An insider told EnergyTrend that current production costs have been reduced almost 50% compare to 2012. Thanks to the improvement in slicing, crystal growth and related technologies, the target to reduce production costs  is promising to be achieved.

	 

	“In the future, thin products will become the mainstream,” explained the insider. “implements of new production processes like diamond wire cutting technology, wafer thinning process and recycling of PEG and SiC are what we strive to develop. In addition, new technologies not only can reduce consumption of raw materials, but also can maintain the efficiency and quality of products. This can help our customer access to products with higher efficiency by controlling costs.”

Demand in the China’s Distributed PV market continues to increase, which caused manufacturers to come up with solutions in response to the trend. From the 8th SNEC Exhibition, which ended last week, we can see that PV service integration has become the strategic focus for Chinese manufacturers.
“In order to respond to downstream demand growth, manufacturers have aggressively expanded their capacities through varying measures. For traditional, vertically-integrated manufacturers, capacity expansion is done mainly by outsourcing. Also, they have approached the small and medium size manufacturers for strategy partnership possibilities. Certain projects are even entering the phase for strategic alliance or directly into merger & acquisition stage. It shows that traditional manufacturers are adopting different business models to minimize risks while accelerating strategy deployments,” says Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
On the other hand, newly joined forces, mainly wafer manufacturers, have gradually entered the downstream market. “Mono-si wafer manufacturers are optimistic about future growth for the China’s Distributed PV market, thus they have also started to produce modules in order to provide more compreshenive services to clients,” adds Hsu. Take Longi for example, apart from the mono-si wafer capacity expansion, the company released mono-si modules and expanded module capacity to 180MW to garner market share within the Distributed PV market. In fact, they are not only expanding mono-si module capacity in 2014 to meet the potential market demand, but they are also taking into consideration that the decreasing subsidies may make mono-si modules more competitive with better long-term profitability.

The U.S. Department of Commerce announced to impose countervailing duties (CVD) on certain Chinese PV cells and modules, hitting Trina Solar with rate of 18.56%, Wuxi Suntech with 35.21% and all others with 26.89%. EnergyTrend forecasts a beneficial result for Taiwanese manufacturers because this phase’s tariffs are higher than the tariffs imposed on 2012. However, the CVD ruling can be regarded as a preview of what may follow with the anti-dumping case ruling, indicating the possibility of even higher anti-dumping duties.
According to EnergyTrend’s research, quotes of PV modules exported from China to USA are between US$0.61~0.71/watt, while quotes of modules exported from Taiwan to USA range from US$0.74~0.81/watt. With a huge price difference of US$0.1~0.13/watt, Taiwan-manufactured modules cost 14%~21% higher than China-produced modules. Nonetheless, Chinese modules no longer have the competitive costs advantage in the US market after the imposed CVD . Adding on the tariffs of previous CVD determined in 2012, Taiwanese modules could take advantage of this situation.
Moreover, the preliminary ruling of anti-subsidy is deemed as a general direction for the anti-dumping ruling in late July. The conclusion of CVD represents that the U.S. government accepted CASM’s petition. Hence, Taiwanese manufacturers, unlike the original sense of optimism, have become more conservative towards the potential rates of anti-dumping duties. Regardless of whether the U.S. DOC completely accepted SolarWolrd’s petition or will set greater limitations on Chinese cells and modules, Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers have to reconsider their future trade strategies in response to the future developments.

Impacted by the surprising initial verdict on unfair subsidies for Chinese solar panels announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), PV manufacturers in both China and Taiwan are now on their toes anticipating the preliminary verdict for product dumping announcement by the end of July. Moreover, with one extra month reserved for manufacturers to deal with transportation and customs issues on the schedule, changes towards market condition in the end of June are emerging. Based on EnergyTrend’s observations, Taiwanese cell manufacturers’ utilizations rate remained high between the beginning of June and mid-June. However, the utilization rates will substantially drop by the end of June.
Taiwanese cell manufacturers’ utilization rates will significantly decline in the end of June, which will affect cell price quotes, according to EnergyTrend’s supply chain investigation. Relevant manufacturers indicated that judging from current condition, cell manufacturers will have enough capacity to handle extra OEM orders for the end of June. In addition, OEM price quotes dropped 15%-20% compared to the beginning of 2Q14. OEM prices at current stage are around US$0.15/watt. In terms of scales, relevant manufacturers can provide 5MW of capacity for OEM during the end of June. Aside from the decreased OEM quotations, cell price quotes have also declined. Indicated by EnergyTrend’s statistics, Chinese manufacturers’ price quotes began to drop since May, while Taiwanese manufacturers’ started to decline in June. Meanwhile, certain manufacturers’ current price quotes have fallen below US$0.4/watt.
On the other hand, PV manufacturers in China and Taiwan continue to follow-up as the anti-subsidy initial verdict may be a reference to the anti-dumping preliminary verdict in the end of July. Therefore, once manufacturers have completed shipments in mid-June, US demand will turn weak before the anti-dumping initial verdict announcement in July. If Japanese and European demand can’t fulfill the decreased US demand, Taiwanese cell manufacturers’ utilization rates will substantially decline in the short run. However, if the anti-dumping initial verdict in the end of July happens to benefit Taiwan, Taiwanese manufacturers’ utilization rates will rebound substantially in August.

Recently, Taiwanese cell manufacturers’ capacity utilization has dropped because of the countervailing duty (CVD) and anti-dumping duty (AD) issues. However, it is rumored that some makers plan to expand their module capacity. Arthur Hsu, Research Manager at EnergyTrend, described this situation as a reaction to U.S. Department of Commerce’s (DOC) preliminary ruling in CVD, which may is being viewed as potentially beneficial to Taiwanese makers, because the costs of Chinese PV module exports to USA will increase. Therefore, Taiwanese manufacturers expect transferred orders, and plans capacity expansion.
Taiwan's module capacity is more than 1GW every year. If the US, EU and other countries indeed imposes high tariffs on Chinese in the future, Taiwanese modules can be more competitive with costs closer to Chinese modules. However, Chinese manufacturers are evaluating the possibility of building manufacturing facilities in so-called “the third party countries” like Mexico, Eastern Europe and India, where they can offer products with lower costs. As long as the final CVD and AD rulings are worse than Chinese makers’ expectations, they would transfer their capacity to those “third party countries” and start mass production in about one quarter.
“On the other hand, if the rulings impose minimum price and volume quota similar to the EU’s ruling, Taiwanese manufacturers may suffer from module capacity expansion,” said Arthur Hsu. “Under such a scenario, Chinese makers can retain their competitiveness and market share by outsourcing to meet U.S.’s market demand beyond the limited volume.”
Hsu adds that the current global module capacity is around 63.2GW, representing a sufficient supply. Although there is still room for Taiwanese module manufacturers to implement some strategic arrangement, they need to tread carefully when it comes to module capacity expansion. It is necessary to consider global module capacity, high subsidies from Chinese government and product differentiation as well when making such a move.

The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) announced on June 17th the withdrawal of FIT certifications for 144 solar plant facilities with capacities totaling 290MW. While there are 288 approved PV projects totaled at 1950MW that have yet to enter the construction phase, METI has the right to revoke these projects’ FIT certifications if they do not start construction by the end of August, according to analysis from EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
“Pressured by the administrative procedures mentioned above, Japanese PV developers have focused on searching for investment partners lately,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend.
Recently, Japanese PV developers have aggressively looked for investment partnership or opportunities to sell relevant certifications mainly because some of them have run into financial difficulties to complete required administrative procedures before required due dates. “The FIT price for these cases is usually JPY 36/kWh. In contrast to other markets, return rates for Japanese power plants are relatively high. Moreover, Japan’s stable political and economical environment allows the nation to become the top one global investment region within the power plant market, attracting investors from China, Taiwan, Europe, and USA,” added Hsu.
On the other hand, although Japan has better return rates, there are many details that need to be paid attention to when it comes to actual practices. The most common problem is the discordance between the actual subsidy received and the amount being made during the assessment. According to METI’s regulations, apart from getting FIT certification from the government, PV developers will also have to sign electricity sales agreement with power companies in order to complete the entire PPA process. Once the PPA process is completed, final FIT prices will be finalized. This has become a common investment dispute since investors tend to neglect double check this part, which led to return rates that did not meet their expectations, added EnergyTrend.

Impacted by the US-China trade war, PV cell manufacturers’ utilization rates continued to drop in June, and thus affected manufacturers’ sales performances, according to EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
“Market demand will remain weak in July before the result of the US-China anti-dumping preliminary verdict is announced. However, manufacturers currently have different strategies because they hold different opinions toward the result. While those that are optimistic about future demand have decided to continue with production, others have decided to focus on inventory control. Yet, clients still hold conservative attitudes toward the result, thus they are less willing to place orders, which added stress on manufacturers’ stocks,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager at EnergyTrend.
Recently, wafer manufacturers’ shipments have been low due to decreased orders from downstream clients, which raised manufacturers’ inventory levels. Certain manufacturers’ inventory levels meanwhile remained unchanged for nearly a month, which affected transaction prices. According to EnergyTrend’s latest price quotes, overall wafer quotation declined US$0.03-0.05/piece. Based on final transaction prices, high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices have dropped below US$1.0/piece to US$0.98/piece. Also, pressured by cost reduction, normal-grade multi-si wafer prices reached US$0.93-0.96/piece. Yet, the pricing may drop to US$0.9/piece if shipments continue to be low.
“Aside from declined prices, polysilicon manufacturers have aggressively asked clients to fulfill their contracts, which added more stress on wafer manufacturers. Since Korean and European manufacturers play more dominant roles when enforcing contracts, adjustments have yet to be made according to spot market changes. Hence, current contract prices remained at US$22-23/kg.

	It was a low period for Chinese and Taiwanese PV industry before U.S. Department of Commerce’s announcement to anti-dumping duties in certain PV imports. EnergyTrend predicts that PV quotations will temporarily remain flat. 

	 

	EnergyTrend finds some influential factors to the weak market, and the anti-dumping and countervailing issue is the most essential one. Because buyers tend to remain conservative before the announcement of the rulings, transactions in the Chinese PV market have already been weakened. The future markets can be changed by the duties, market strategies therefore need to be adjusted according to the conclusions. Adding that PV stock in the U.S. market takes at least one to one and half months to complete clearance, PV quotations will not rapidly increase recently.

	 

	Data collected by EnergyTrend shows that high-efficiency wafers’ price dropped US$0.03~0.04/piece to US$0.95/piece. This was resulted from the weak market demand, which may negatively influence volume of stock. Aside from flat prices, sellers also offer more transaction modes such as pay after delivery or lower cash prices for specific customers.

	 

	Regarding the spot market, quotations continue to decrease due to weak demand and stock pressure. High efficiency multi-si wafers’ price rapidly decreased 2.76% to US$0.953/piece this week. Multi-si wafers’ price dropped 0.21% to US$0.933/piece as well. However, moni-si wafers’ price slightly increased 0.08% to US$1.183/piece during the same period. At the same time, quotes of Taiwan-made PV cells dropped 1.47% to US$0.35/watt because of the conservative market. Likewise, China-made PV cells’ prices were diminished by both the domestic and overseas demand markets, dropping 2.03% to US$0.338/watt.

                                Demand for Chinese PV Makers Turns Weak as Preliminary Anti-Dumping Tax Rates Exceeded Expectation                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140731-7154.html,"

The growth potential in North America has always fascinated PV makers, and US’s affirmative preliminary determination on the anti-dumping (AD) duty of this time would be the key to Chinese and Taiwanese PV makers’ future in North America. How these manufacturers obtain favorable positions afterwards remains to be seen. “Because Taiwan and China face similar preliminary anti-dumping tax rates, Chinese module manufacturers are more likely to use Chinese cells in the future. Meanwhile, Taiwanese cell makers are pessimistic about their future as they may begin to lose Chinese orders. US PV manufacturers, in contrast, can increase their competitiveness due to the extra tariffs. PV makers from other regions, including Korea, Japan, and Malaysia, may benefit from the high AD and CVD imposed on Taiwanese and Chinese makers,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
AD Tax rates for major Chinese manufacturers fell between 26.33%-58.87%. The combined duty rates of AD and CVD, which is previously announced, have fallen between 29.3%-82.38%. Among all, Trina Solar stood out in terms of tariff rate because it mainly focuses on North America. Its combined duty rate of 29.3% was much lower than other competitors, such as Yingli’s (47.27%), Suntech’s (49.24%), and Jinko’s (82.38%). “Merchandise covered in the investigation in 2012 was excluded from the investigation this time. Thus, Chinese makers can pick what is more suitable for them between the two investigations for customs declaration. In other words, Chinese makers can use their own cells to minimize the costs and complete customs declaration based on the AD and CVD rates confirmed in 2012. It’s estimated that Chinese module manufacturers will mostly use their own cells from now on. As for other Chinese makers that have combined duty rates of 191.93%, tax rates will have limited impact on them since their focus is not on North America,” added Hsu.








Taiwanese Makers will no Longer be Chinese Makers’ Major Middlemen 
Hsu further pointed out, “after the final determination for the US-China trade war was announced in 2012, Taiwanese cell manufacturers’ sales increased significantly due to the orders transferred from China. Also, China continued to take advantage of the loophole to maintain its low-cost strategy in North America and this could be the main reason why AD tax rates turned out to be more than expected for Taiwan. After adding the AD tax rates, costs for Taiwanese modules shipped to the US will increase to US$0.75-0.865/watt while cell costs will increase to US$0.445-0.565/watt. Compare to US’ local module prices, Taiwan’s high-efficiency products is the only products that have competitive advantages.”
What’s worth mention is that in the preliminary determination this time, there were no restrictions on the products shipped to the US from a third-party country. Therefore, Taiwanese makers’ global deployment in the long-term will be critical. Currently, Motech already built production sites in Japan and North America. SAS has just finished its module expansion in Europe. Module factory – e-Solar, which was joint ventured by Eversol and Japan, has started to take the lead. Gintung is also getting ready to build module production lines in Mexico in order to fulfill large demands in North America.

After the US announced its preliminary determination on the CVD and AD duty, PV makers in both China and Taiwan have been confronted by high tariff rates. Module and cell prices shipped to the US have started to increase substantially, and thus led to solar investment cost uptick in North America. However, thin-film products were not covered in the investigation this time. Therefore, North America will have great potential for thin-film makers, according to EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of TrendForce.
“Aside from First Solar, other thin-film manufacturers that focus on CIGS technology have aggressively seized market shares in North America, hoping to increase CIGS market shares in the global PV market,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend. Solar Frontier, a leading CIGS manufacturer, has already activated its global strategy deployment. The company revealed its products for mass production in Intersolar North America, surpassing industry standard, and also came up with corresponding solutions toward demand in North America. Meanwhile, Hanergy aimed at distributed PV applications. Through mergers and acquisitions, Hanergy could accumulate relevant patent and technology know-how in a fast-pace. In addition, the company built partnership with Tesla, a leading EV brand in North America.
“Current price quotes of CIGS products in Europe and USA are around US$0.75/watt. Compared to the previous price quotes of si-base modules – US$0.65/watt, the price difference is about 15.4% and about 4% in terms of conversion efficiency difference. After the US’s preliminary determination on the CVD and AD duty was announced, si-base module costs increased 35%-49%. Furthermore, the amount of power generated by thin-film products is about 10% higher than si-base products (under the same scale). Thus, when it comes to power generation costs, CIGS products have better competitiveness and that’s why Solar Frontier and Hanergy are beneficial from the investigation this time,” added Hsu.

After US announced its preliminary determination on the CVD and AD duty, the momentum in the market has turned weak rapidly. Module and cell manufacturers were the first to be challenged by the decreased capacity and increased inventory. In order to reduce operating pressure, PV cell and module makers hope to stimulate the market through price adjustment. Thus, price quotes declined significantly, which led to upstream wafer and polysilicon price adjustment as well.
“Wafer makers are currently facing a difficult situation in which they have to try to fulfill the contracts requested by polysilicon makers while meeting the price-cutting demands from downstream clients,” said Arthur Hsu, research manager of EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. Wafer prices have been adjusted since August and may decline further in the future. High-efficiency wafer price quotes for first-tier manufacturers were US$0.9-0.92/piece and US$0.86-0.88/piece for second-tier manufacturers, indicated by EnergyTrend’s database.
On the other hand, Taiwanese wafer manufacturers have actively increased their OEM ratio to fill the unused capacity caused by the weak demand. In the meantime, wafer prices have started to be below manufacturers’ break-even point. “The break-even point was at US$0.54/piece for first-tier makers and around US$0.56/piece for second-tier makers. Certain OEM quotation even approached US$0.5/piece, down 10% compared to the break-even point. It will bring substantial impact to makers’ profits if they continue to raise OEM ratio. Yet, the high raw material costs caused manufacturing costs to remain high. That’s why wafer manufacturers can’t adjust prices according to market changes,” added Hsu.
The industry is optimistic about 2H14 as demand in China and Japan will increase significantly. It’s estimated that more orders will be placed in 4Q14, and hence rumor has it that polysilicon manufacturers may revise the contract prices upward to US$24-25/kg. But since no compromise has been reached yet for both buyers and sellers, prices within the contract market may continue to be divergent in the short run.
In terms of cell, Taiwanese manufacturers’ lowest trading prices came to US$0.32/watt, which fell at the same range as Chinese manufacturers’. Therefore, the gross margins were mostly negative for Taiwanese manufacturers.

                                Change in US Anti-dumping Duty May Boost Capacity Utilization Rates of Taiwan Solar Firms                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140822-7284.html,"

On August 19, the US Department of Commerce announced it had revised the preliminary anti-dumping duty on solar products produced by Motech Industries in Taiwan, causing Motech’s tariff rate to drop from 44.18%, the highest among Taiwanese producers, to 20.86%, the lowest. For other Taiwanese photovoltaic (PV) producers, the average duty rate has fallen to 24.23%.








“Given the revised duties imposed on Taiwanese makers and the high quality of Taiwan’s products, Taiwan may still get US orders indirectly if Taiwanese vendors are willing to sacrifice some gross margins,” said Corrine Lin, an analyst at EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
The US’s previous higher anti-dumping duty caused Taiwanese PV cell prices to fall significantly. They have dropped more than $0.06/watt in Taiwan and PV cell products on the island now retail for about the same price as first-tier Chinese company. 
Although PV cell prices will remain low in the short run, first-tier cell manufacturers’ capacity utilization rates have generally improved, Lin said. “Chinese demand has also finally begun to increase and China will temporarily close the loophole of polysilicon importing through export processing zones (EPZs) in order to avoid tariff rates.” Lin added. Consequently, additional import duties will be imposed on foreign polysilicon products in the Chinese market, Lin said, adding that as polysilicon imports decline, Chinese upstream polysilicon and wafer makers may be the first to raise prices.
At the same time, demand is picking up in Europe and Japan, leading to more orders this week of products that are of better quality than their competitors but similarly priced. 
With orders from Europe and Japan on the rise and Chinese demand increasing, utilization rates for both Taiwanese and Chinese producers are unlikely to be problematic, but gross margin has not yet returned to where it was. Additionally, while the market has cheered Motech’s revised duty rates, lowering prices is usually the only way for Taiwan producers to stand out from their competitors. Finally, the most pressing issue for Taiwan’s PV cell producers at this point is the lack of a dedicated port to export their products.

DuPont is stepping up its attacks on the customers of its competitor Samsung SDI, alleging that by using Samsung SDI’s front-side metallization paste, they are infringing on DuPont’s own patented tellurium paste technology. DuPont is using legal channels to attempt to sever the ties between Samsung SDI and its customers, according to EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
Samsung SDI’s front-side and back-side metallization pastes sold extremely well in the mainland China market in the first half of the year, penetrating into its main industrial supply chain, said Arthur Hsu, a research manager in EnergyTrend. “Samsung SDI is becoming dominant in the mainland China front-side and back-side metallization paste markets, seriously threatening DuPont’s share of those markets,” Hsu added.
Although the quality of Samsung SDI and DuPont’s products are roughly equal, Samsung SDI’s are priced more competitively, which appeals greatly to price-sensitive Chinese businesses. Meanwhile, despite DuPont’s patent infringement litigation, mainland China industry has not significantly lowered its usage of Samsung SDI products. Indeed, Samsung SDI’s share of the China silver metallization paste market remains at 30-40%, which is very similar to DuPont’s.
Since DuPont’s initial attempts to sue Samsung SDI directly were not successful, it changed course and went after Samsung SDI’s customers. TrendForce believes the clash between DuPont and Samsung SDI may affect the market in several ways. On the one hand, other industry players such as Giga Solar and Heraeous may benefit. At the same time, metallization paste supply and demand may change. It is worthwhile to continue following the situation closely.

Taiwan photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers have received rush orders since the end of August, leading to higher utilization rates and boosting optimism among Taiwan PV producers about demand in September. Yet Chinese demand remains weak as Chinese PV manufacturers have yet to reap the benefits of supportive Chinese government policies, such as subsidies for manufacturers. The market is exhibiting trends that are both bearish and bullish, and that is causing prices to diverge,” said Arthur Hsu, a research manager in EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. “We expect in the short run that changes in price will vary by market sub-sector and product.”
Since China decided to impose countervailing and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports in order to close the loophole, analysts generally believe producers outside China will benefit. Also, high polysilicon prices may fall. US polysilicon prices have already dropped in Taiwan and similar products have fallen below US$20/kg to about US$19.5/kg. Although these are not top quality products, they perform nearly as well. Since top quality polysilicon products remain priced at US$22.5/kg, comparable products for US$19.5/kg seem relatively attractive.
Both wafer and cell prices slightly increased. Chinese multi-si wafer prices increased 3%-5%, with final prices reaching 6.2-6.4 CNY, according to EnergyTrend’s research. Because Chinese market prices have been trending upward, Chinese wafer producers have lowered their export volume, which caused Taiwan wafer producers to raise wafer price quotes. Although Taiwan cell manufacturers’ utilization rates continued to increase, cell prices only increased slightly due to certain trading factors. The current cell quotation is between US$0.33-0.34/watt. It is less likely mainstream multi-si cell prices will surpass US$0.34/watt.

Since overall Chinese market prices have stabilized and demand is picking up in Taiwan, high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices increased 0.22% to US$0.92/piece, while normal-grade remained flat. Cell demand remained weak in China, leading to steady cell prices in China. Taiwan cell makers’ price quotes increased due to the uptick in cell utilization rates. Taiwan cell prices reached US$0.332/watt, up 1.57%. The outlook for module demand is uncertain in China because the market has yet to respond positively to supportive Chinese government policies. Module prices remained steady as shipments to Europe, USA, and Japan are back to normal. Yet, prices are likely to fluctuate in the short run.

                                China issues new policy to boost distributed PV market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20140912-7407.html,"









The China National Energy Administration announced a new policy on September 4 aimed at bolstering the distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) market. “This new policy will loosen current regulations, which will give the market a needed push,” said Arthur Hsu, a research manager at EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
China has high hopes for distributed PV. This year, it aims to add 8 gigawatts of solar energy for small users and 6 gigawatts for larger projects, which would make it the largest market for photovoltaic. Yet it is struggling to reach those goals.
China’s distributed PV market must overcome three main hurdles – financing, grid connection and electricity price subsidies, Hsu said, adding that Beijing’s new policy addresses all of those issues. Indeed, the new policy will encourage financial institutions to offer discounts on loans and longer loan terms for distributed PV projects. That will help alleviate financial strain on firms investing in distributed PV. Additionally, the new policy is intended to expand the usage of solar panel installations in public infrastructure. Under the policy, solar projects will also be connected to low-voltage grids built on deserted areas, hills, agricultural greenhouses, lakes and ponds. At the same time, China’s new policy also aims to stimulate innovation in the distributed PV industry, especially in the combination with the greenhouse gas emissions and carbon trading, and the construction of the solar leasing mechanism. Given China’s ambitions to become a major player in carbon trading, investors have cheered the new policy.
Thus far, China has only assembled 1 GW of distributed PV this year, or 12.5% of its 8 GW target. “To reach its goal for 2014, China will need to assemble 2 GW per month in the next 4 months,” Hsu said. “That’s good news for global solar manufacturers.” Yet Hsu cautioned against excessive optimism about the policy. “It is beneficial for the development of China’s distributed PV market – that’s for sure,” he said. “But we need to wait and see if it is capable of driving growth in the near term.”

More than a month after the US International Trade Commission's (ITC) anti-dumping and countervailing duties ruling against China's and Taiwan's solar makers, the effects of that decision continue to shape those firms’ business strategies. Amidst trade disputes with the US and EU, Chinese solar manufacturers have begun moving production offshore over the past two years, said Jason Huang, a research manager at EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. For instance, the solar manufacturer CSUN has set up factories in Turkey while ReneSola, also a Chinese solar firm, is using OEM models in Japan, Korea, India and Poland to sidestep trade barriers and unfavorable taxation rates. With a new round of anti-dumping and countervailing duties expected, JinkoSolar will build its 100-120MW modules in South Africa. Yingli Solar and Suntech Power may also increase production capacity overseas.
Taiwan producers are also ensnared in the latest round of anti-dumping investigations in the United States. While the duty rates may ultimately change, combined pressure from declining sales and rising prices will compel Taiwan vendors to gin up overseas manufacturing. Currently, Tainergy Tech has established cell and module production lines in Vietnam. Solartech Energy has built a solar cell production line in Malaysia. Other vendors plan for upstream manufacturers to build module production lines in Thailand. Cell manufacturers also have plans to develop solar cell or module capacity in the Americas in the 100 - 200MW range.
While overseas production may help Chinese and Taiwanese vendors negate the effects of trade disputes and taxation, those firms are also considering weaker economic conditions and an increase in local labor costs as they continue to move production offshore. Producers are weighing the needs of the local market as well as their organizations’ global strategy, Jason Huang said, adding: “But costs remain paramount for most solar manufacturers. Emerging markets are certainly catering to that focus on costs by offering tax breaks and other perks to attract foreign investment. Whether the solar industry can truly develop in those markets, however, remains open to question.”
Cells produced by Korean and Malaysian manufacturers, who have not been hit by the US anti-dumping and countervailing duties, are currently priced at US $0.40-$0.42, about 20.5% higher than those made by Taiwan firms. That gives Taiwanese firms leverage to negotiate with customers. At the same time, while well established globally as high-efficiency cell producers, Taiwanese vendors are hampered by their limited access to export markets. As a result, they face greater demand fluctuations. With that in mind, many Taiwanese firms are choosing to set up their factories in foreign countries close to major export markets.

Although supply and demand are fluctuating heavily in the global solar market, the market’s preference for high-efficiency products has remained consistent, with Taiwan manufacturers leading the way, according to EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. Sunrise Global Solar Energy, which is now a subsidiary of Sino-American Silicon Products, is the market’s pioneer in applying PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Cell) technology in the solar cell production process. Other firms using the technology include Motech, Gintech Energy and Neo Solar Power. “PERC offers better efficiency at a competitive cost, which is causing demand for the technology to surge,” said Jason Huang, a research manager at EnergyTrend.
The improved solar cell technology means the wattage of a single module is increased while the cost of each unit is decreased. That brings down the overall production cost considerably and makes high-efficiency products especially attractive to system developers. However, PERC performance varies. In polysilicon cells, PERC increases efficiency 0.6%, but in monosilicon cells 0.8% to 1%. “Monosilicon cells see the greatest gains from PERC technology,” said Huang. “That’s why Taiwan vendors will focus on expanding monosilicon cell production capacity in the second half of the year.”
Taiwan solar cell manufacturers currently are utilizing PERC technology more than of any of their competitors aand have about 1 GW of PERC production capacity. Two firms in the China market to watch are JA Solar, which is developing faster than any of its competitors and Canadian Solar, which aims to implement PERC technology in its production process soon. Monosilicon modules made with PERC technology have a power output of more than 280W and since there very few are manufactured in China, the prices for solar cells within this power efficiency range are different than standard monosilicon modules. Currently, demand from Japan is strongest. Once demand picks up in other markets, profits will rise for Taiwan cell manufacturers.
Among cell manufacturers, PERC technology is viewed as the best way to increase efficiency, because the equipment used in production and the process itself do not differ greatly from traditional methods. Manufacturers can use PERC to reduce capital expenditure while boosting efficiency. PERC application in the future will also influence the usage of monsilicon and polysilicon wafers. Currently China’s top monosilicon and polysilicon wafer producers are Longi Silicon and Zhonghuan Huanou. The top Taiwanese producer is AUO Crystal.
This week’s price quotes 
Prices for October should be set to continue rising as demand for high-efficiency cells increases. Yet as China will take a week-long national holiday beginning October 1, prices in the past week have not changed much. The average price for polysilicon is US$20.34/kg. The low-priced wafers are up and stable since the end of September. High efficiency and standard polysilicon wafer prices are the same as last week. As for cell prices, low-priced products have decreased slightly. By contrast, module prices have risen continuously for two weeks, increasing 0.52% to US$0.575/watt as producers take turns boosting average prices.

                                China, Japan to fuel solar demand surge in fourth quarter                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141003-7527.html,"









In the past, Europe accounted for the greatest share of global solar demand and dictated the market’s movements, but as the Asia-Pacific market fast expands, China and Japan are playing a much larger role. Demand from those two Asian countries usually rises sharply in the fourth quarter and carries through to the first quarter of the following year. “From early September, the entire supply chain has been preparing for the imminent surge in demand from China and Japan that will come in the fourth quarter,” said Jason Huang, research manager at EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. When that demand shoots up, second and third-tier companies will use OEM orders to increase their utilization rates and the overall utilization rate will return to more than 85%, Huang added.
While polysilicon prices were stable for the most part, they did decrease incrementally because of ongoing trade disputes in the third quarter. Those disputes also caused international polysilicon manufacturers including Samsung and Tokuyama to delay expanding production capacity. As a result, there was not a significant increase in polysilicon raw material shipments. As the trade disputes drag on, China has temporarily halted processing trade applications, and is using that as leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S. The U.S. government’s final decision in December regarding anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar manufacturers will affect whether Beijing will continue to use tariffs to bar U.S. polysilicon imports, Huang said, adding: “The polysilicon market will be more volatile in 2015 if China and the U.S. cannot reach an agreement on anti-dumping and countervailing duties.” That could lead to polysilicon prices rising in the Chinese market, but falling sharply in other markets.
There are two emerging long-term trends in the silicon wafer market. First, top manufacturers will acquire greater market share as demand for efficiency increases.  Second-tier and third-tier manufacturers will not be able to meet that demand because of technology limitations. Second, to raise power output, silicon wafers may become larger. Alternatively, manufacturers will return to developing mono-like wafers.
Taiwanese cell manufacturers have long been dominant players in the development of high-efficiency cells. To increase product competitiveness as they expand into new markets, they have boosted monosilicon production capacity. The Taiwanese manufacturer Neo Solar Power’s (NSP) monosilicon production capacity is now close to 50% of its total production capacity. Other manufacturers have also increased monosilicon production capacity. Taiwanese vendors’ monosilicon production capacity in 2015 is expected to reach 30-40% of their overall production capacity.
In the module sector, global production capacity exceeded 64GW in the fourth quarter, well over 40% of global demand. Despite high volume production, there have been marked differences in utilization rates since modules can be easily adjusted. For instance, in the third quarter, some second and third-tier manufacturers’ utilization rates fell below 50%, with some even halting production. From an annual perspective, six out of the top 10 global module manufacturers (including thin film manufacturers) are from China. More than seven module manufacturers will ship over 2GW of products, while Yingli Solar and Trina Solar may ship over 3.5GW of solar products. The two companies are expected to maintain shipment volume of more than 1GW in the fourth quarter. Compared to 2013, these manufacturers’ shipment volumes increased more than 30%, and far exceeded global demand growth. Shipment volumes are now concentrated among top manufacturers.
This week’s price quotes 
Despite China’s week-long October holiday, prices have not been affected too much. Currently, fourth quarter orders look stable, but manufacturers are waiting for the end of the holiday in China to see if prices rise as expected. Right now nothing is for certain. Polysilicon prices fluctuated this week as expected, rising 0.29 percent to US $ 20.4 / kg. Low-cost silicon wafer prices held steady, while standard polysilicon and monosilicon wafers rose 0.22% and 0.85%, respectively, to US $ 0.9 / pc and US $ 1.18 / pc. There were no large changes in cell prices. Chinese cells did increase 0.32 percent to US $ 0.315 / watt. Module prices remained the same as last week.

                                Chinese solar manufacturers buoyed by supportive government policies                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141009-7552.html,"

For Chinese solar manufacturers, the fourth quarter is the most important time for solar photovoltaic installations. It is then that Chinese vendors speed up deployment to meet the central government’s annual targets. The Chinese government’s support for renewable energy bolsters their efforts. If that support continues, the productivity of Chinese solar manufacturers will increase in tandem.
The latest draft of China’s renewable energy policy, which outlines targets for 2015, 2017 and 2020, respectively, differs considerably from the previous draft issued in 2012, said Jason Huang, research manager at EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. First, basic renewable energy targets have risen for the most part. Second, the nexus of development has shifted from the northwest of China to the east, where the China National Energy Administration wants more solar systems built. Third, the policy sets forth mandatory renewable energy requirements. Renewables - excluding hydropower - must comprise a certain portion of total power consumption by 2015 and 2020, respectively, and meet basic standards or advanced standards promulgated by Beijing. Petrochemical power facility construction will be restricted for local Chinese governments, including autonomous regions and cities, which fail to reach the basic standards. By contrast, Beijing will reward regions that reach advanced standards. They will receive more generous renewable energy and electric grid construction subsidies as well as other financial support.
The China solar industry aims to reach 100 GW of solar PV deployment cumulatively by 2020, targeting 10-15 GW annually from 2014, Huang said. In 2015, the following provinces will each be responsible for 10% of deployment: Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Gansu, Ningxia and Xinjiang. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Qinghai will be responsible for 7% of deployment, respectively. Shanghai , Jiangsu, Anhui and Fujian will each account for 4%. Finally, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Chongqing will only comprise 2% of deployment, respectively.
In recent years, the solar market’s focus has shifted from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region, with China and Japan leading the development of solar energy systems, Huang said. “With Beijing’s backing, China’s impact on the global solar market will be far-reaching. Chinese demand for solar energy will become the decisive factor in the market’s ability to grow sustainably,” he added.
This week's price quotes 
With China’s week-long October holiday just wrapping up, there were few changes in prices this week. October orders are steady, while the plant utilization rate is similar to September. Polysilicon prices held at US $ 20.4/ kg, while there were some minor changes in wafer prices. The prices of some high-efficiency polycrystalline silicon wafer orders increased slightly. Monocrystalline silicon wafer prices decreased. Cell and module prices remained the same as last week.

                                US anti-dumping, countervailing duties cast shadow over solar market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141017-7601.html,"

The US International Trade Commission recently announced it would extend the final decision of countervailing duties on solar photovoltaic (PV) imports from China and change the scope of the investigation to target modules and cells. However, a 2012 decision on Chinese cells prevails, so they will not be affected by the ITC’s recent amendment. By contrast, duties will likely be slapped on Chinese modules, irrespective of where wafers or cells used in the modules are produced. Taiwan manufacturers, meanwhile, should expect for modules produced in Taiwan to be investigated as well as third-party module manufacturers who use Taiwan-made cells.
The ITC’s new amendment to the 2014 anti-dumping and countervailing duties simplified the criteria under which Chinese modules can be targeted, said Jason Huang, a research manager at EnergyTrend, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. As a result, it is now easier for the US to block imports of Chinese modules. Originally, if Chinese modules used silicon wafers produced outside of China and cells produced in Taiwan, they could avoid the duties, Huang said. “But this new amendment is a game changer. Now if companies like Yinlgi, Suntech or Jinko choose to manufacture modules in China, they will produce cells themselves rather than using cells made in Taiwan. This will ensure the modules are only hit with the lighter 2012 duties rather than the new, higher one. This will cause market demand for Taiwan-produced cells to plummet.”
As a result of the amendment to the US’s anti-dumping and countervailing duties, Taiwan cell manufacturers will see a drop in orders from Chinese vendors. Meanwhile, Chinese silicon wafer manufacturers, who enjoy a cost advantage, will be unaffected. They will be able to keep prices down. But wafer manufacturers outside of China will be undercut by those low prices.
Most modules shipped to the United States sell for US$0.75~0.8/W and enjoy a reasonable profit margin. But if vendors choose a third-party destination to produce cells or modules, they can save $0.04~0.06/W and boost profits, Huang said. “Developing production capacity outside of Taiwan or China will be instrumental for Taiwanese and Chinese solar firms to remain profitable in the future,” he added.








This week’s price quotes 
Prices this week were relatively stable with some minor increases. Although demand from China was less robust than expected, most polysilicon prices still increased to US$20.7/kg, up 1.47% over the previous week. Polysilicon wafers prices saw little change. Demand for monosilicon decreased slightly and prices fell 0.85%to US$1.17/pc. Cell and module prices were almost identical to last week.

                                Solar manufacturers vie for control of nascent N-type mono cell market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141027-7645.html,"


	Neo Solar Power’s (NSP) N-type bifacial monocrystalline cell, recognized for its high efficiency, was launched at the PV Taiwan 2014 exhibition in Taipei last week. Taiwan is a key player in the manufacturing of high-efficiency solar cells.

	 

	The N-type cell is likely to become the next-generation high-efficiency mono cell, replacing the current mainstream P-type mono cell in the future, said Corrine Lin, an analyst at EnergyTrend, a division of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. Currently, the PERC production process, with less capital investment than the N-type mono cell process, can boost cell efficiency from 19.2%-19.4% to 20%-20.2% using P-type mono cells, Lin said. Since N-type mono cells currently have an energy conversion efficiency of 22%, they surpass P-type mono cells’ efficiency target easily. Therefore, N-type mono cells are expected to become the next-generation mono cell. Additionally, the N-type mono cell’s initial light induced degradation (LID) is close to 0%. It is also able to generate electricity well under dim lighting and achieve even higher efficiency efficient after being packaged as a module.  

	 

	SunPower, Panasonic, and Yingli were initially the only N-type mono cell mass production manufacturers, but other international brands are now entering the market fast. Those new entrants include Silevo, which was recently acquired by SolarCity, LG Electronics and Mission Solar. Given their prowess in the solar cell market, Taiwanese firms are expected to excel in the production of N-type mono cells. NSP, Motech and Inventec are the new N-type mono cell entrants among Taiwan firms. The front side of NSP’s N-type bifacial cell presented in the exhibition can reach efficiency of 20.4%, while the contribution of the back side is 20%, meaning the total conversion efficiency is 24.5% and can produce 60-cell modules that reach 330Wp of power. Motech also plans to become capable of delivering N-type mono cell products to their clients next year. 

	 











	 

	Although prospects for N-type mono cells are good, there are obstacles they must overcome before they can enter the mainstream solar market. “Buyers in the solar energy market expect products to be low cost but high value,” Lin said. “But at this early stage of development, it is expensive to implement N-type mono cells in the production process. Until clear demand is demonstrated from buyers, few manufacturers will invest in the development of N-type mono cell production lines.”  With that in mind, it could be a long time before N-type mono cells become mainstream in the solar market.

                                EU mulling anti-circumvention measures on Asian countries solar exports                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141031-7679.html,"

Following the anti-dumping and countervailing measures imposed by the United States on Chinese and Taiwanese solar PV manufacturers, the European Union is now investigating other Asian countries for allegedly helping China violate the terms of a solar-export agreement it has with the EU, said Jason Huang, a research manager at EnergyTrend, a division of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. The European Union and China previously reached an agreement that allows solar panels from China to be sold to Europe in limited volumes at a fixed price, but EU ProSun, a joint initiative of European solar businesses, alleges that other countries are importing unfinished Chinese solar products, putting the finishing touches on them and then exporting the products to Europe he said, adding that South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan are currently being investigated.
In June, EU ProSun presented documents to the EU Committee that alleged Chinese solar products were being sold to Europe for less than the minimum price China and Europe had agreed upon. EU ProSun said that China went through multiple channels to sell solar products to Europe for below the agreed minimum. The EU Committee rejected EU ProSun’s allegations, but in August, when it was rumored that new anti-dumping investigations would be launched, many manufacturers clarified their statements and denied they had been investigated. But recently some manufacturers have confirmed that they are being investigated and say they are complying with investigators. “If Asian manufacturers are guilty of helping Chinese solar firms circumvent the agreement China has with the EU, the EU may impose a 47% duty on all of their solar exports, as they did previously to Chinese manufacturers,” Huang said.
Since a new minimum price of solar products exported from China to Europe has not been announced officially, the price for the fourth quarter may be lower than the price set in April, which was 0.53/watt. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturers have cost advantages in the European market. To avoid being hit with anti-dumping levies, they are trying to clarify that they don't help Chinese makers to circumvent the minimum price agreement. Data show that Europe accounted for 18% of Taiwan’s overall module exports in 2012 and 29% in 2013. Europe is Taiwan’s second-largest module export market. Japan is the largest.








Meanwhile, since the US’s decision on the countervailing act on China’s solar exports will be postponed, a decision on the anti-dumping act will be postponed as well. That was originally scheduled to be announced in mid-December. For now, it is essential that the US and China come to a minimum price agreement similar to the one between China and Europe. The results of the agreement will not only affect the US solar market and Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers, but will have a major impact on the global solar supply chain, Huang said.
This week’s price quotes 
As a result of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties, there were some urgent purchases and considerable price fluctuation in the supply chain. However overall, the price for polysilicon was stable. Some silicon wafer prices moved 0.5% and monocrystalline silicon wafer prices dropped the most. China cell prices rose 0.31% to US$0.319/W while Taiwan cells decreased 0.9% to US$0.332/W. This is a concern for the Taiwan cell market as it is nearly November. Modules prices in China are stable as is demand for modules.

                                Chinese solar module exports to Southeast Asia surge                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141107-7711.html,"









The Philippine Department of Energy (DOE) said recently it would accelerate the development of renewable energy projects, emphasizing the importance of producing energy locally to ensure energy security. Thus far, the Philippine DOE has made minimal progress in its renewable energy endeavors. It has cancelled more than 100 renewable energy project contracts that it has signed with other parties.
To increase the efficacy of its renewable energy projects, the Phillipines DOE will undertake a number of measures. Those measures include boosting the wattage of solar electricity systems from 50 MW to 500MW and shortening project processing time from two years to 45 days, said Angus Kao, a research manager at EnergyTrend, a division of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. “These efforts by the Philippine DOE could help to increase foreign investment in its renewable energy projects,” Kao said.
In early October, as it celebrated its twelfth birthday, the Thailand Department of Energy also rolled out an energy plan of its own. The plan calls for speedy procurement of a 2000 MW electricity system from solar factories next year.
China’s largest module export markets are in Southeast Asia. Among them, the Philippines and Thailand are Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. In the first half of 2014, China exported 158 MW to the Philippines and 98 MW to Thailand. Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam are China’s third, fourth and fifth largest module export markets, respectively. “Because the Philippines’ renewable energy policy is becoming clear, China’s module exports to the Philippines grew 19% to 43 MW in August,” Kao said.
This week’s spot market prices 
There are a number of factors affecting the supply chain. Demand from the Chinese domestic market is stable and growing gradually. By contrast, Europe has entered the offseason as the weather cools and Japanese demand is falling because of grid restrictions. Overall, polysilicon prices are stable. Polysilicon wafer prices are stable thanks to Chinese demand. Major price fluctuations are not expected. Monocrystalline silicon wafers continue to fall, down 0.68% to US $ 1.165 / pc. Cell prices in China are stable. But Taiwanese manufacturers are feeling pressured to lower prices, which decreased 0.6 percent to US $ 0.33 /w. That means the demand for Taiwanese cells is limited as is the range that prices will increase. Module prices have remained the same thus far in November.

Japanese electricity companies are temporarily scaling back their involvement with solar projects as solar supply outstrips demand, threatening to wreak havoc in the market, according to EnergyTrend, a division of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. In September, Kyushu (X) Electric Power Co., Ltd. became the first Japanese firm to announce it would not sign any additional purchase contracts with solar manufacturers until further notice. Soon after, Kyushu, Shikoku Electric Power Company, Tohoku Electric Power Company, Hokkaido Electric Power Company and Okinawa Electric Power Company also announced they would not take on any new solar power projects. Meanwhile, current Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) schemes heavily skewed toward solar power have led to some problems. As a result, the Mineral and Natural Resources Division of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is mulling whether to adjust the FiT schemes of different renewables, and have decided not to place too much emphasis on solar power. Some scholars and experts are expected to submit relevant reform proposals by the end of the year.
“Japan has always been seen as a market with stable policy in solar power and has room to grow, but recently, as policy has become unpredictable, some major solar projects have been affected,” said Angus Kao, a research manager at EnergyTrend. “This may herald the end of Japan’s solar power revolution.” Still, the residential solar power market is emerging in Japan and qualifies for government subsidies, Kao said, adding that companies are beginning to offer comprehensive services in that sub-sector.
Research by EnergyTrend shows that the exported modules from China to Japan in the first half of 2014 hit a record high. And China’s percentage of both Japan’s 255W and 260 W imports has grown from 14% in the first quarter to 21% in the third quarter. Japan is also Taiwan’s primary module export market. Taiwan exported almost 200 MW to Japan in the first half of 2014. But Taiwan’s share of the Japanese market is relatively low compared to manufacturers from China.
There are still some manufacturers in Japan who have been approved for solar projects and they have deadlines to meet, so the market will continue to grow for a while, Kao said. But in the future, Japan’s solar market will grow at relatively slower pace and its focus will switch to roof-based solar systems, he added.
This week’s spot market prices 
Prices remained virtually unchanged this week. China manufacturers are rushing to fill orders by the end of the year so wafer and cell supply are tight. Meanwhile, the US’s decision on the anti-dumping and countervailing duties is not yet clear. If policy remains stable in the US and Japan, this will ease fears in the global solar supply chain. Polysilicon prices this week were stable as supply and demand were balanced. Domestic demand in China helped demand for polysilicon wafers to remain stable as well.. Standard multi-crystalline prices remained the same. Monocrystal wafer prices dropped 0.86% to US$1.155/pc as supply was abundant. Regarding cells, the demand in China was strong and the supply was limited so prices moved 0.31% to US$0.32/W. But prices in Taiwan dropped to US$0.325/W mainly because domestic demand in China, the main market for Taiwan cell exporters, is not robust right now, while Taiwan’s share of other cell markets is much smaller. Module prices remained in the same range and only went up slightly.

                                Module Output Key to Reducing Cost of Solar Systems                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20141120-7792.html,"









Solar PV manufacturers are switching over to higher efficiency monocrystalline cells to increase power output, but for solar energy systems, overall module output is key. “In order to balance costs and the power efficiency of solar systems, it is important to reduce CTM (cell to module) loss as well as place greater emphasis on module assembly technology and materials application,” said Jason Huang, research manager at EnergyTrend, a division of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce.
A number of solar PV firms are working to bolster module output. For instance, SunEdision has developed zero white space (ZWS) technology that boosts performance by optimizing the solar module itself. ZWS utilizes the area between cells, eliminates losses from bus bar shadowing, and reduces electrical losses. That reduction in losses and additional active area generate higher power output. Other solar firms are using larger silicon wafers and more efficient cells, such as Komax Solar. Its HIP module has a larger area than a typical module and uses shading reduction to enhance output.
Module power output of 60 pcs of polycrystalline cells is primarily 250W and 255W. But there is a new 300W module available that offers many advantages. Winaico's 300W module adopts the M1 mono-si wafer, which is larger than the traditional P-type mono wafer, and uses PERC technology. Along with special conductive pads with LCR (Light Capturing Ribbon), this technology can effectively reduce efficiency losses in the assembly process.
By balancing module output and overall system cost, it is possible to both use expensive high-efficiency cells and reduce other costs associated with solar systems such as brackets, cables and land area, Huang said. “The high-wattage 300W output module offers an opportunity to reduce system costs 5-8% from the current mainstream 250W module,” he said. Currently, modules account for 28-35% of the overall cost of a solar system, so boosting module output can result in significant savings per system unit. Cost advantages to higher output modules are especially evident in markets where labor costs are high, such as the US and Japan, Huang added.
This week’s spot-market prices 
Prices in part of the supply chain fell this week. Notably, polysilicon prices remained weak. Special high-efficiency and high-efficiency polysilicon wafer prices were flat but Chinese polysilicon wafer prices declined. There was a slight decline in monosilicon wafer prices of 0.43% to US$1.15 / pc. Cell prices remained the same as polycrystalline did not move at all. Polycrystalline modules fell 0.87% to US$0.573 / W while monocrystalline modules did not change significantly.

The result of the US-China anti-dumping and countervailing measures will be finalized on December 11th. The U.S. has narrowed down the investigation to modules and cells only in October. Despite the origins of the wafers/cells, the investigation this time mainly focuses on Chinese-made modules, while all Chinese-made cells are subject to the 2012 rulings and are excluded from the investigation. In addition, Taiwan-made modules or any third-party country that uses Taiwan cells are also covered in the investigation. Although the average cell tax rate in Taiwan was lowered after Motech’s tax rate was revised downward in August, it’s still relatively high compared to the cell duty rate adopted by Chinese manufacturers in 2012.
Starting from 3Q14, Chinese module manufacturers have begun to use Chinese cells to produce modules domestically. Thus, while Chinese cell shipments to the U.S. are imposed the 2012 duty rate, Chinese demand for Taiwan cells has reduced. We can see from the data analysis of Taiwan cell export customs, Taiwan cell export to China represents 57% in 2Q and it dropped to 33% in 3Q. Export to Japan and Germany, the two largest export countries in Taiwan, each represents 13% of Taiwan’s total export. Export ratio in 4Q will continue to fluctuate based on the demand and policies in different countries, which show that government’s policy adjustment will also affect end-user demand.
“In addition to the export countries mentioned, Taiwan cell export ratio to Malaysia and Singapore slightly increased too, with both representing 12% of Taiwan’s total export in September,” said Angus Kao, a research manager at EnergyTrend, a division of the Taiwan-based market intelligence firm TrendForce. Furthermore, Taiwan begins to ship products to France, South Africa, and Mexico, showing that the whole PV supply chain is changing after the US-China trade war takes place. Currently, module manufacturers are active in planning global strategies and building production sites in different regions to avoid future trade disputes and supply local markets closely.

The global demand is expected to reach 51.4GW in 2015, with an annual demand growth rate of 16.5% and an increased installation of 7GW compared to 2014, according to EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce. In terms of the supply end, the Chinese makers has announced to expand production capacity in 2015, with an increase of 4.2GW in module production capacity, taking up 8.2% of the worldwide demand; non-Chinese module makers will increase production capacity by 1.1GW, which is approximately 2% of the worldwide demand.
Angus Kao, analyst at EnergyTrend, indicates that in 2015, the majority of the solar makers will be expanding production capacity in a more rational manner; the increased production capacity will mainly be on par with the increased demands. However, the trend that the bigger players will remain strong has already emerged. In addition to the existing production advantage, the bigger makers also have international level of brand management, with higher brand recognition. Therefore, the future key to winning the market will depend on who can first complete the global strategic planning, diversifying to minimize the risk, and strengthen the technology and quality, enter the PV system business, and make use of the sales channel advantages.
Angus Kao further indicates that, due to the new U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties final ruling, it is expected to accelerate the new module plant establishment in various countries in Southeast Asia. A projected new production capacity of 1GW or more in this area is also expected, and this is another focal point to look out for in the future.












This week’s spot prices 
Due to China’s increased import volume and also affected by the sufficient stocking, polysilicon prices remain weak, falling at 1.49%, and the average price fell to US$19.8/kg. As for the wafers, due to the continue falling prices for the upstream multi-si raw material, the wafer prices have began to be affected. High efficiency multi-si wafer and mono-si wafers both fell slightly by 0.44%, and the spot prices are US$0.901/pc and US$1.14/pc, respectively. As for the solar cells, since there are no other policy factors affecting the price, the deep price plunge is looking back up, the solar cell price quotes are generally rising. In addition to the effect of next year’s mainstream specifications for modules are rising to 260W, the high efficiency solar cells are clearly going strong, with a spot price increase of 0.9%, and the average price hits US$0.335/w.
In terms of the modules, since the multi-si module product’s main stream specifications are going to be increased to 260-265W, along with no expected factors pushing for large scale price increase, the 250-255W module price dropped slightly by 0.35%, with an average price of US$0.573/w. Due to the U.S. and European holidays and weather factors, Mono-si modules orders decreased, with a mild price drop of 0.31% this week.

                                Prices Will Remain Flat for Downstream Sectors of Solar Energy before the Chinese New Year                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150108-8058.html,"









The overall PV market price in the first quarter of 2015 will remain constant until the end of the Chinese New Year; afterwards, shipment demand will decrease and the price will drop, expected EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce.
The beginning of holiday season in China meets the end of the holiday season in the US and Europe, and this means that there is a reduction of working hours in China happening at the same time with a return of purchase orders from the US and Europe. Also, the global market demand is expected to grow as domestic demand in China picks up and Japanese firms in downstream sector are stocking up materials before the end of their fiscal year.
Angus Kao, analyst at EnergyTrend, indicated that the price of Chinese polysilicon in the short term will be sustained as China is ending the processing trade of polysilicon from the US and Korea. However, price hike will not occur soon since China imported a vast quantity of polysilicon last year. It will take at least one to two months to exhaust China’s huge stock. Even with the new productions in the coming quarters, the chance of material price increase depends on favorable policy changes and depletion of inventory. With all factors considered, EnergyTrend predicts that the spot price for polysilicon will remain the same until the end of the Chinese New Year, with a minor drop afterwards and spot price is expected to stay between US $18-20/kg.
Kao stated that with polysilicon supply being plentiful and high-efficiency multi-Si wafers being the chief demand of downstream firms, the key influence behind the price of wafers in this quarter will be technical capabilities. The first-tier manufacturers will maintain their prices either by launching a newer generation of multi-Si wafers or increases the efficiency of existing models to response to the market trends. Those manufacturers that can provide higher efficiency’s products will be able to keep their prices, those that cannot will have to slash their prices to increase sales. EnergyTrend anticipates that the overall price will remain stable, fluctuating between US$0.88-0.90/pc. The price for mono-Si wafer has yet to recover from its sluggish state. Expect them to move slowly downward.
The uncertainty caused by the US Department of Commerce’s recent decision on the 2014 US anti-dumping and countervailing case, meant the China is still the largest market for Taiwanese solar cell manufacturers, followed by Europe and Japan. Hence, the price depression of Taiwanese solar cells will continue. EnergyTrend projects that Taiwanese solar cells, including high-efficiency multi-Si cells, will face a gradual price drop, with the average price between US $0.32-0.325/W. Any significant price fluctuations will be dependent on the final outcome of the 2014 US anti-dumping and countervailing investigations.
Due to the US Department of Commerce’s favorable administrative review of 2012 anti-dumping and countervailing case, solar cell prices will also remain flat and constant for the first-tier manufacturers in China as they will be receiving most of the orders. Anticipate a slight and gradual price decrease after the Chinese New Year because of the weakening demand. The US policy is less effective against the fragmented downstream market in demand of high-efficiency multi-Si solar cells.
The orders for solar modules will concentrate on the first-tier manufacturers in China, filling their production capacities. This again is because of the decision of the US Department of Commerce that allows Chinese solar cell and module makers to export at a lower rate. The impact of foreign modules on the US market is significant as the unit price will suffer a drop greater than 5%. Nonetheless, other regions will not be affected and they will maintain their price stability.
The module prices for the second-tier, OEM manufacturers, in contrast, are expected to lower as orders are going to major, first-tier brand manufacturers. EnergyTrend anticipates a trend in greater price differentiation between first-tier and second-tier solar modules in the future.'

                                TrendForce is Optimistic about 2015 Market for Lithium Cell as Q4 in 2014 Shows Moderate Price Fall                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150112-8075.html,"

The overall demand for lithium batteries for the 2014 cycle was steady despite some turbulences. The first half of the year saw a strong promotion for power banks. This was followed by a push for prismatic laptop batteries as well as popular large-screen handheld devices driven by Apple in the second half. These factors affected the supply and demand for cylindrical, prismatic and polymer battery markets. Duff Lu, Research Manager of EnergyTrend, a research division of TrendForce, stated that the steepest price decline in the fourth quarter of 2014 goes to polymer cells, with most models having price decline just under 5%. The price for prismatic cells, which is related to the production base period, also fell significantly in the short term, between 3~5%. Compared with the former two types, the cylindrical cells remained relatively constant. Although demands and prices will fall slightly in the first quarter of 2015, the long-term, year-long outlook for battery price is stable and chances of great fluctuations will be rare.
Supply for All Cell Types Stabilizes 
Lu predicted that the cylindrical cell production will continue its decline. The priority for Panasonic, Sony, Samsung SDI, LGC, and other Korean and Japanese cell manufacturers is to shift production to electric car-related applications. Battery makers will seek to find a balance between electric car and consumer products as to avoid problems like overproduction and poor gross margin performance following low capacity batteries’ exit from the market. Such strategy will affect future prices.
Quality was still the main issue for polymer cells in the third quarter of 2014. As a result, the supply of smartphones batteries fell behind schedule in the fourth quarter. This caused a chain reaction that led to demand exceeding supply for the first-tier manufacturers. This was in stark contrast to polymer cells for laptops, which overall maintained its previous quarter’s production level in the fourth quarter.

Cell Prices Remain Low 
Lu further noted that with Apple iPhone as the only bright spot in the 2014 fourth quarter market, major suppliers are now focusing on the supply and demand of polymer cells. China’s subsidy policy and expanding production means that the price war among polymer cells will continue. The factors behind lower prices also include the phablet phenomenon, leading to smartphone’s sizes matching tablets’. Both devices are moving toward similarity in battery capacity, thus allowing greater battery interchangeability between them. Therefore, polymer cell’s unit capacity price in the fourth quarter had a steady 4~5% drop.
The steady demand for electric car batteries encourages the growth of cylindrical cell production and slows down the price decline. Even though the demand for cylindrical cells in IT sector shrinks, their market demand ratio is boosted by high capacity cells. And with the base demand from the auto sector as a support, the price for cylindrical cells is stabilizing. The situation where 3.0 Ah cells are starting to become cheaper than 2.2 Ah counterparts just shows how quickly the lower capacity cells are leaving the market.
The price for prismatic cells so far has been volatile because these cells are at the start of mass production. EngergyTrend forecasts that prismatic cell price will stabilize when the market reaches equilibrium in supply and demand.

                                Costs, Intensive Sunlight, and Policies Lead to High Potential for MENA Solar Market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150116-8114.html,"









The MENA region is widely recognized as a high potential solar market, and 2015’s first solar-related exhibition - World Future Energy Summit 2015 (WFES), will take place in Abu Dhabi on January 19. Lower costs for large-scale solar installations, strong solar irradiation and national supports are all the factors for MENA to develop solar power.
The Middle East Solar Industry Association (MESIA) states that the cumulative solar installation in the Middle East in 2014 has grown rapidly. The growth was mainly triggered by the lower construction costs for large-scale PV plants, which decreased from USD$7.0/w in 2008 to USD$1.5/w in 2014. In 2013, only four large PV plants with capacity higher than 10 MW were constructed. On the contrary, there are 40 PV power plants to be constructed in 2015, 10 times more than in 2013.
Aside from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), more than 10 MENA nations, including Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Qatar, would start to install solar PV systems. Most of these nations have launched solar generation plans starting from 2015 and Saudi Arabia is the most ambitious one among all. It plans to install 6GW of solar PV systems over the next 10 years, turning it into the largest market in the region.
The sandy desert surrounding the MENA region means intensive solar irradiation and much longer hours of solar power generation than mainstream markets like Europe and USA. Nonetheless, solar panels installed in such environment could be easily abraded. The frequent damage caused by the natural environment therefore indicates a higher requirement for solar products’ qualities. Currently, most PV projects in the MENA region are submitted and constructed by large Chinese or Korean EPC companies as there is no local solar supply chain. It is crucial to integrate the whole production lines as well as send specialists to supervise the construction for MENA market development.
This Week’s Spot Price
Polysilicon prices slightly dropped 1.52% to USD$19.5/kg. The Chinese markets’ demand was not as strong as expected, so multi-si wafer price quotes decreased. The average spot price of high-efficiency multi-si wafer declined to USD$0.89/piece, while the mono-si wafer’s price continued drop due to the weak demand, reaching USD$1.135/piece.
In terms of solar cell price quotes this week, demands from the Chinese markets remained flat so cell orders significantly dropped, causing multi-si cell prices to drop to USD$0.315/W. In contrary, PV module price quotes kept declining and the situation is expected to continue until the Chinese New Year.

                                Japan Announces Revision of Renewable Energy FIT                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150122-8145.html,"

The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) of Japan recently presents a revised draft for Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme and proposes new power output solutions, aiming to provide the maximum amount of renewable energy installation. First, it lists out some revisions for systems:
	1. Make amendment on facility coverage to control the output
	2. Change the current plan for limiting renewable electricity output without compensation to the operators of renewable energy power generation facilities (so-called ""30-days rule"") from a daily basis to an hourly basis
	3. Renewable energy generation facility operators must build remote output control systems
	4. Increase the utility capacity to connect renewable energy power generation facilities to the grid, through utilizing the Specified Electricity Utility System
Some other things will be re-examined as well, including measures to be implemented by each utility regarding the issue of suspending applications and special measures for Fukushima, and so on.
	ANRE will also make revision of the current operation system of the feed-in tariff scheme. Firstly is to make solar purchase price more reasonable. Secondly is to avoid companies from applying for renewable energy provision contracts in order to secure their right to meet energy grid quotas without concrete business plans. Lastly, it is to ensure the site location of the facility to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts to local communities.
	All of the above measures are created by Japan in the hope of a more balanced system for renewable energy. It’s expected that Japan’s new renewable energy policies will impact PV installation. What we can foresee at this point is that the number of large-scale ground-mounted PV plants will be reduced, while FIT will be lowered at the same time. ANRE is still seeking public opinions for the revision, according to local reports.
 This week’s spot market prices
Polysilicon from China reduced significantly in January, thus polysilicon spot prices dropped 0.51% to US$19.4/kg. Super high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices slightly declined to US$0.942/piece due to the weaker downstream demand. Although first-tier mono-si wafer manufacturers could stick to US$1.135/piece, prices for second-tier manufacturers dropped followed weaker demand. This week’s multi-si cell prices decreased 0.31% to US$0.32/w because of the weaker demand caused by the US-China trade war. The average multi-si cell prices in China reached US$0.314/W. The depreciated exchange rates in Europe/Japan and weaker demand after February caused 250w multi-si module prices dropped 0.17% to US$0.572/w.

                                Taiwanese PV Makers to Establish More Overseas Markets under US’s Punitive Duties                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150130-8195.html,"









The final determination of the US’s anti-dumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) duties against certain Chinese and Taiwanese solar PV products has been announced this month, and Taiwanese makers are suffering from more severe impacts than Chinese makers. According to EnergyTrend’s customs export trade statistics, both the price and the volume of Taiwan’s solar cell exports in 2014 decreased. Still, they shipped their products to more overseas markets.
The customs export trade data collected by EnergyTrend shows that Taiwanese PV cell vendors exported cells totaled 4GW in the first half of 2014 (1H14), and reached an export value of USD$1.73 billion. The top five export markets are: China, Japan, Malaysia, Germany and Singapore, while the shipment to China accounted for more than half of the total export. Most shipment to China during this period was to fulfill orders from the U.S. Therefore, Taiwanese cell manufacturers enjoyed sufficient orders and positive financial results as well as beneficial gross margins in 1H14.
Furthermore, Taiwanese makers shipped a total of 3.82GW of PV cells in the second half of 2014 (2H14). During this period, Canada ranked the fifth place of the top-five export market chart and its share of shipment to China reduced from 51% to around 40%. Total shipment in 2H14 slightly declined 4.5% compared to 1H14 while increased 5% compared to 2H13. Nonetheless, 2H14’s export value, USD$1.356 billion, rapidly dropped 21% from 1H14. The value also represented a 12.8% decrease comparing to 2H13’s USD$1.556 billion. In addition, solar PV cells’ average export price per unit in 2H14 dropped 18% from 1H14, or 17% y-o-y.
According to EnergyTrend’s research and observation, Taiwan PV cell prices would continue to decrease in the near future, yet the downturn seems to be lessened. The final determination of AD/CVD duties reinforces Taiwanese makers to come up with new strategies, such as lowering PV cell prices, exporting products to other overseas markets, and relocating their global manufacturing lines. To protect themselves from further trade disputes, Taiwanese vendors should introduce visionary production and marketing plans on the basis of the globalization of module manufacturing facilities.








This Week’s Spot Prices
As the new market strategies being unveiled, transactions in the PV market are relatively flat. Polysilicon price quote remained at US$19.4/kg. Quotes of multi-si wafers, on the contrary, have declined due to the decreasing PV cell prices and more low-priced orders. Super-high efficiency multi-si wafer’s average price dropped 0.21% to US$0.94/piece, while high-efficiency multi-si wafers’ quote slightly dropped 0.34% to US$0.887/piece. Besides, mono-si wafers’ price kept dropping to US$1.132/piece due to more stock and weak demand.
Weak demand also led to downturns of PV cell prices. High efficiency multi-si cells’ quote dropped 0.91% to US$0.328/w; price of standard Taiwan multi-si cells has dropped below the US$0.32/w threshold to around US$0.318/w. Likewise, Chinese standard multi-si cells’ quotes dropped 0.64% to US$0.312/w. Additionally, mono-si cells’ weak demand led to a 0.48% reduction and the price hit US$0.416/w this week.
In terms of PV modules, some first-tier module manufacturers started to introduce 255W~260W multi-si PV modules to catch up with the latest trend in this quarter. The market trend caused 250W PV module price slightly decreased 0.35% to US$0.57/W.

Due to increases in both shipments and conversion efficiency, Taiwanese PV cell makers experienced a record shipment growth in 2014, according to the latest report by EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. This growth was in spite of being under the anti-dumping and countervailing investigation by the United States International Trade Commission (referred to here as the USITC) during the year. The shipments of Taiwanese PV cell makers in 2014 had an increase of 20% compared with the previous year, officially breaking the 10GW ceiling and setting a new all-time high.
NSP’s shipments soared ahead of Motech in 2014, thus clearly demonstrating its expanded production capacity after its merger. NSP became the leader among Taiwanese PV cell manufacturers in 2014, accounting for 22% of the total annual shipments. Motech and Gintech follow closely with 16% and 15% shipment shares respectively. Overall, the three leading Taiwanese firms made up 53% of the total shipments. However, anticipate changes in 2015 when Motech’s merger of Topcell will be finalized by the end of June. Motech’s post-merger production capacity is estimated to reach 3GW, giving it the opportunity to retake the number one position.








EnergyTrend’s analyst Angus Kao pointed out two significant challenges facing Taiwanese solar firms in 2015. The first challenge is the anti-dumping and countervailing duties against Chinese imports and the anti-dumping duties against Taiwanese imports following the USITC’s vote on Jan. 21st. Major Chinese PV module manufacturers will be compelled to choose Chinese cells instead of the Taiwanese since the tariff rates set against the former are lower. As a result, orders from China will therefore fall drastically. The second challenge is demands from European and Japanese clients to have prices lowered in response to the steep depreciation of the euro and yen. Taiwanese PV cells going to those markets will face considerable price pressure in the future.
A survey of orders received from January to February indicates that Taiwanese firms experienced only a slight decrease in exports because of demands from Japan and the need to stock up before the Chinese New Year holidays. After March, however, the Taiwanese PV cell makers will feel the effects of reduced exports to US. Also, they will be moving their production lines overseas. Therefore, shipments will be negatively and significantly impacted. Following the third quarter, it is likely that Taiwanese firms will be able to reestablish connection with the United States when they have finished with their relocation. By then, the established peak season will also return along with rising demands from Europe, America, Japan and China. PV cell shipments from Taiwan will likely to enjoy a resurgence during that period.
“Global solar installations are gradually moving away from the large, ground-mounted PV systems for power plants to commercial applications and solar roof panels for homes,” Kao further noted, “and for that reason Taiwanese PV companies need to improve PV cells’ conversion efficiency.” At the same time, Taiwanese cell makers should bolster their mono-Si cell production capacities in order to match the production of modules with higher wattages and the shift towards niche end markets. Taiwanese firms also have other urgent matters to address in addition to increasing battery efficiency. These include creating a business model beyond just making and selling PV cells as well as developing new sales channels and markets.
This Week's Price Quotes
Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, this week’s market prices reflected a downtrend. Polysilicon manufacturers are conservative toward the prices after the Lunar New Year, and thus few of them planned to stock up. Polysilicon prices dropped 0.52% to US$19.3/kg. Wafer demand also turned weaker, while the amount of low-priced orders increased. Super high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices declined 0.21% to US$0.938/piece.

As it enters into February, the off-season market before the long Chinese New Year vacation leads spot prices of certain solar PV products such as polysilicon, wafer and PV cells to drop. Prices of PV modules remain relatively flat because of the decrease of both supply and demand as some manufacturers has started enjoying the vacation.
EnergyTrend finds that the current job of most solar PV manufactures is to clean their stocks. Under such a situation, quote of polysilicon has dropped to US$19/kg following previous weeks’ weak performances. Nonetheless, China’s National Energy Administration has established a 15GW target of solar PV installations in 2015, including 8GW of centralized PV plants and 7GW of distributed PV generations, and this is expected to drive the domestic demand for the nation’s surplus production of polysilicon.
First-tier multi-si wafer manufacturers are mostly working on their full capacity for orders earned before the vacation. They are also focusing on earning orders from abroad. In contrary, most second-tier manufacturers are working on constant OEM orders. The rest manufacturers with smaller capacities are dealing with orders that have to be delivered in mid-February or rush orders. In general, orders in February are affected by the upcoming Chinese New Year and less workdays, so both ultra-high-efficiency and high-efficiency multi-si wafers’ quotes continue to decrease. Quotes of high-efficiency multi-si wafers have dropped 0.23% to US$0.879/piece while the quotes of mono-si wafers reduced to US$1.115/piece due to weak demands and stocks.
Regarding the market of PV cells, although the demand for high-efficiency cells becomes stronger, quotes keep dropping due to, similarly, the Chinese New Year’s day offs. It is impossible for manufacturers to complete the customs declaration processes for either import or export during next week. Adding the fact that orders for Taiwan-made PV cells has already reduced, quotes of multi-si PV cells all decreased in this week. The price of multi-si cells reduced slightly to UD$0.326/w, Taiwan-made multi-si PV cells met a spot price as low as US$0.316/w, while the quote of Chinese multi-si Pv cells dropped to US$0.309/w.
Currently, there are many suspended PV project constructions due to the severe climate, and the situation causes certain impact on demands for PV modules. Thanks that Japan’s demand remains stronger than Europe and America’s, PV modules are mainly focusing on cleaning their stocks. In spite of the overall weaker demand, the module supply reduced because some second- and third-tier manufacturers have already started their vacation and would not be back to work until late February or early March. As the short-term demand decreased along with the short-term supply, quotes of PV modules remain relatively flat compared to other PV products. The price of 250W multi-si PV Modules slightly dropped to US$0.567/w this week.

On Feb.24th, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced it will make a substantial cut to the PV rate in its feed-in tariff (FiT) program for renewable energies. The rate of return for the PV system as a whole has also been revised significantly downward. This in turn seriously affects Japan’s 2015 PV market, which is projected to shrink perhaps by 20%. This will naturally add uncertainties to the global market. The 2015 PV EXPO, which took place in Tokyo during the final week of February, reflected the shift in the market towards residential applications, including high-efficiency modules and storage systems for home use. As FiT programs around the world are seeing a rate reduction, end users will base their decisions on unit cost. It is expected that low-cost systems will become mainstream this year. High-efficiency PV products on the other hand will require practical solutions that reduce system installation and labor costs in order to become more attractive.
Angus Kao, an anlayst of EnergyTrend of TrendForce, said the development in the global PV market will likely resemble Japan, and the entire supply chain will see some volatility in the market during March. “Orders are returning, but the market will not completely turnaround,” Kao added, “and the average spot prices for PV products will keep going down because the upstream inventories are still plentiful.”
As for polysilicon, most plants began work on schedule. However, downstream manufacturers officially began work in turn on Mar.2nd and after. Moreover, most of the present dealings involve getting rid of the existing inventories, so spot trading is expected to be light. Non-Chinese polysilicon manufacturers have piled up stocks during Chinese New Year holidays, so their average spot price has bigger drop-off range and is projected to arrive at US$16.5/kg. The price for Chinese polysilicon is generally flat because there is still a sizable existing stock. Until it is used up, the price for Chinese polysilicon is unlikely to go up. The price for polysilicon in March is estimated to be in the range of US$16-19/kg.
The price for wafers has come out flat as well, with wafers from the first-tier manufacturers staying at around US$0.86-0.87/pc. The first-tier manufacturers are still expecting that the price will eventually be kept at US$0.87/pc or above. For the second and third-tier manufacturers, however, they are seeing their wafer price falling to US$0.85/pc because demands have yet to return. If the second and third-tier manufacturers continue to slash their prices in order to grab more orders and make profit from quick turnover, then the average wafer price is likely to gradually fall in March.
Regarding the price of PV cells, it will experience a small fluctuation. The first-tier manufacturers have already received their orders before Chinese New Year. The second-tier manufacturers on the other hand began work later, so they are just now starting production one by one. Demands from Japan are returning and manufacturers dedicated to this market have done well in terms of incoming orders. Orders from other markets, however, are still unconfirmed, and this is affecting both production and price. Quote prices are set to remain weak. EnergyTrend projects that the price of high-efficiency multi-Si cells will be around US$0.32-0.33/w. The price for Taiwanese multi-Si cells will fall to US$0.30-0.31/W, while the price for the Chinese counterparts will fall to US$0.29-0.30/W.
As for PV modules, most manufacturers have kept a normal level. The number of completed system installations in China last year was lower than expected. The manufacturers will continue working on unfinished installations of ground-mounted systems as well as taking on new projects. Furthermore, this year’s market projections for commercial and residential rooftop systems has been positive. On the whole, the general market outlook for PV modules is optimistic. On another note, high-efficiency modules from mainstream brands are now capable of reaching 260-270W range for multi-Si and 275-285W for mono-Si in terms of output. Modules with an output of 300W and over were also revealed at the PV EXPO. Kao believes that with the mass production of high-efficiency modules becoming steady and regular, it will take about six months for a generation change. High-efficiency modules will see their prices stabilize as they replace the older 250-255W modules. Their prices in the near future might also even be slightly lower than their current prices. Low-efficiency modules by contrast will see their prices fall as they are being phased out from the market.

The rise of the urban population in different countries stimulates energy demand day by day. Overall cylindrical battery demand will increase 32% YoY from 882 million to 1171 million (figure 1); energy storage market will also grow from 40MWh in 2010 to 1850MWh in 2020 (CAGR: 50%), according to a research by EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce.
If energy consumption continues to follow the same cost pattern and fail to cope with the spirit of sustainability, the greenhouse gas concentration in 2050 may grow one times higher than that in 2012. By then, climate change will be more severe. That’s why countries have been encouraging the use of green energies, including energy subsidy policies or industrial regulations, leading to booming energy industry development. On the other hand, like mentioned before, energy storage market will grow from 40MWh in 2010 to 1850MWh in 2020 (CAGR: 50%), according to a research by EnergyTrend. In fact, people’s general impression of energy storage systems in the past were power banks, thus energy storage systems were mostly used in industrial sector. However, due to the wide use of renewable energy and higher request for energy efficiency nowadays, energy storage systems have started to be used in residential and architectural markets. The following are the market-driven factors for the energy storage market – dramatic increase in the use of electricity, rising electricity prices, higher request for energy efficiency, and lower energy storage costs. From the supports of both supply and demand side, the development of renewable energy will focus more on energy storage systems from 2016 to 2020. In addition, green industry will become an indicator for sustainable development under the downtrend of gross margin in IT industry.

LEV and BEV markets have also become more popular following the rise of environmental awareness. Cylindrical battery demand within mobile carriers will increase 30% YoY from 111 million in 2014 to 145 million in 2015, according to EnergyTrend’s statistic of 4Q14 (figure 2). Hence, it’s a perfect timing for battery cell manufacturers to enter the LEV/BEV markets because fewer cells will be needed in IT sector as IT will put more emphasis on ultra-thin products. Meanwhile, power tools have stricter requests for product life time due to the higher power outputs, leading to stably increasing power tool market development. Yet, the number of cells used in power tool markets may begin to reduce as well because of increasing battery capacity. Overall battery demand in power tool market may remain flat at 220 million in 2015, according to EnergyTrend’s investigation in 1Q15.

PV demand has started to increase this month, according to EnergyTrend’s observation. End-market demand for high-efficiency cells/modules has also reflected an uptrend. In the end of 2014, 250W 60-cell multi-si module remained the mainstream product, but the power output has reached 255W this quarter and will even reach 260W-275W by next quarter. While usual outputs for 60-cell mono-si module are between 260W-275W, there are 280-285W products coming out this year, which shows that PV market continues to work on technology improvement and development for high-efficiency products. In PV EXPO 2015, which was held in Japan last month, various manufacturers unveiled high-efficiency products, in which 300W mono-si modules showcased by Taiwanese, Japanese, and Korean manufacturers caught the most attention.
Chinese module export volume continues to increase, according to China customs export data. The export volume increased 12.3% (November) to 2120MW in December 2014. EnergyTrend also noticed the rising export ratio for high-efficiency modules from Shanghai export statistics – export ratio for 255W modules increased from 14% to 17% and 260W from 8% to 11%. In contrary, export ratio for 250W modules has dropped from 28% to 17%.
By using high-efficiency modules, it can reduce system costs and raise the power generated per unit area. In addition, due to lower PV subsidies and module/system prices, high-efficiency modules can ultimately increase the ROI for PV systems and thus will continue to be the focus in the future.
This Week's Price Quotes
Although orders from Europe and US were only a few because of the severe weather, total orders slightly increased from last week. It’s estimated that downstream manufacturers’ capacities have grown 10%-20%. Since old polysilicon stock clearance hasn’t been completed, this week’s polysilicon spot prices dropped 0.53% to $18.7/kg.
Due to the price reduction requested by downstream cell clients and lower polysilicon prices, wafer prices remained weak. Super high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices decreased 0.55% to $0.905/piece. High-efficiency multi-si wafer prices reached $0.86/piece and mono-si wafer dropped 0.91% to $1.09/piece.
High-efficiency multi-si cell prices declined 0.93% to $0.32/w.
While Taiwan multi-si cell prices dropped 0.96% to $0.31/w, Chinese multi-si cells declined to $0.30/w. Module demand from China turned weak, but demand for high-efficiency modules increased. Price for 250W multi-si module slightly dropped to $0.561/w; average price for 265W mono-si modules is $0.621/w.

                                PV Prices to Stabilize Following NEA’s Announcement of 17.8GW Installation Target in China, Expects EnergyTrend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150320-8439.html,"









China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) announced on March 16 that it has revised the country’s overall PV installation target from the original 15GW to 17.8GW. Additionally, the government will increase its efforts to supervise closely on the previous year’s projects that are unfinished and ongoing. The government has also taken further steps to loosen the regulatory control over the installations of rooftop solar systems.
China’s production of PV modules reached 35GW in 2014, according to Angus Kao, analyst for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. Out of the total PV module production in 2014, 60% went to and relied on exports. Furthermore, top ten domestic PV module manufacturers in China accounted for 56% of the production and had the capacity utilization rate of close to 90%. For module manufacturers with less than 500 MW in terms of production scale, however, their average production utilization rate reached a low of 72%. Kao stated that the NEA’s big raise in the installed capacity target can provide immediate relief for Chinese module makers affected by excess capacities and tariff duties levied by importing countries. Nonetheless, Kao believes the rapid expansion of PV module manufacturing in China in the last few years has led to products varied widely in quality and price wars. The NEA’s target therefore will not improve the industry’s situation on the whole.
“The policy’s main beneficiaries will be manufacturers with sound financial health and strong technological advantages,” said Kao, “so the industry will enter its integration stage where only the fittest will survive.”
The current survey of the market and supply chain shows high inventory levels in the upstream sector and the reduction of stocks is slower than anticipated. Clients from Europe and Japan are delaying placing orders and deliveries because of the depreciation of their currencies, thus lowering the number of visible orders. The manufacturers in the downstream sector have slowed down in their purchases since the start of March, reflecting fewer-than-expected orders at their end as well. Most manufacturers are cautious on their assessments for April’s incoming orders. As a result, prices along the entire PV supply chain so far have kept a downward trend. However, Kao anticipates that China’s internal demands will be stimulated by NEA’s announcement, causing orders to return and prices to stop falling and stabilize in both the upstream and downstream sector.

                                PV Prices Continue Dropping Due to Weak Demand and Surplus Supply                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150327-8481.html,"









The first quarter of 2015 is coming to the end, yet spot prices of PV products have been dropping for almost three months. The stock clearance at the end of this quarter and weak demand are mainly blamed for declines of the whole PV supply chain from polysilicon, wafer to cells, according to EnergyTrend’s investigation.
During this week, prices of polysilicon dropped due to surplus supply from high utilization rates as well as stock clearance. Starting from late February, PV demand in Mainland China has shown a downturn so the market has been relatively flat. First-tier PV manufacturers are striving to maintain their utilization rates but are unable to reach the full capacity utilization, not to mention second and third-tier manufacturers. In the meantime, first-tier wafer vendors’ high utilization rates not only led to surplus supply, but also slowed down the steps of wafer stock clearance. With the weak demand, slow stock clearance and high production capacity, both polysilicon and wafers’ prices went declining in March as well as in the entire quarter.
PV vendors’ price strategies further pushed down the product quotes. EnergyTrend finds that wafer and cell manufacturers which have no long-term supply contracts would cut prices when the market demand becomes weaker and raw material prices start to decline. By doing so, they can win more orders. The reduced spot prices would reinforce their rivals to cut prices for competitiveness. Such a situation shows how different manufacturers act among the flat market. In March, spot price of polysilicon has dropped 7%, while price of wafer has decreased 1.7%. The downturn involves in spot prices of PV cells, which has declined 3.2% in the same period. Overall, the spot prices of the whole PV supply chain demonstrate a downward trend this month.
The surplus supply of polysilicon may be fixed in the second quarter, EnergyTrend projects. First, China’s Manual for polysilicon’s deep processing transit will be finalized before the end of June, so polysilicon supply is expected to balance gradually. Second, the raised PV installation target, 17.8GW, is likely to drive new constructions starting from May or June and may consume more polysilicon. According to EnergyTrend’s investigation, PV demand in April seems to be higher than in March. Therefore, it is expected that the market demand will be higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter, stopping the downturn of PV products’ spot prices.
This Week’s Spot Prices
Spot prices of PV products, including polysilicon, mono-si wafer and PV cells, all dropped subsequent to the previous weeks.
The polysilicon stock clearance led to a 5.03% drop to an average price of US$17/kg. In addition, the weak demand and rival price strategies cause super high efficiency multi-si wafer to decrease 0.44% to US$0.895/piece, while the price of high-efficiency multi-si wafer decreased 0.35% down to US$0.852/piece averagely. Likewise, quotes of mono-si wafer declined 0.93% to US$1.06/piece.
High efficiency multi-si PV cells’ quote has dropped 0.95% to US$0.312/w. In Taiwan, spot prices of multi-si cells decreased to US$0.55/w, representing a slight drop of 0.36%. China-made multi-si PV cells’ price was US$0.292/W. Also, quote of 250W multi-si PV modules slightly reduced 0.36% to US$0.55/W and the quote of mono-si modules was US$0.611/W, according to EnergyTrend’s research this week.

During this week, the PV supply chain performed a wait-and-see attitude like previous weeks, and the trend of spot prices of PV products remained flat. Through the recent downturn of the price trend, PV manufacturers have found that price slashing doesn’t bring them more orders, so they turned to be more conservative. The manufacturers tend not to cut PV products’ prices because the reduced prices can’t be transited into orders and shipments. In addition, most PV makers are looking at the market performance in April instead of swinging spot prices now.
EnergyTrend acquires that PV products stock clearance accounted a lot for the PV price downturn in March. In April, the price trend would be determined by the market demand. On one hand, it is projected to have a stable PV market in Japan this year. On the other hand, U.K. led the European market in the first quarter but the future demand would be relatively flat because the nation starts to limit its large-scale PV power plant applications since April. Additionally, market demand in China, where have no large-scale PV project starting construction in 2015 yet, is expected to emerge after the SNEC exhibition in Shanghai in late April.
When it comes to the  supply chain, wafer manufacturers which signed long-term agreements with polysilicon suppliers need to purchase polysilicon by higher prices. However, PV cell makers from the downstream chain tend to reduce their costs by buying cheaper wafers. The dilemma forms a restriction to wafer prices’ drop range. Currently, quotes of high efficiency wafers made by first-tier wafer manufacturers are among US$0.84~0.86/piece, while the quotes of second-tier manufacturers remain at US$0.83~0.85/piece. Aside from wafers, the lowest quote of Taiwanese multi-si PV cells dropped down to US$0.29/w, which was close to Chinese PV cells. Such a low quote doesn’t bring any profit to Taiwanese makers. Nonetheless, the spot prices and costs of PV cells would remain so in near future as long as there is no any rapid price decrease in the upstream part of the supply chain.
This Week’s Spot Prices
Spot prices of polysilicon slightly dropped $0.1/kg to an average price of $16.9/kg. In terms of wafers and PV cells, the drop trend has slowed down compared to previous weeks. Price of high efficiency multi-si wafer decreased 0.23% to $0.85/piece. In the meantime, price of mono-si wafers have dropped to $1.058/piece in order to increase their market share. Spot price of high efficiency multi-si PV cells slightly dropped 0.64% to $0.31/w, while Taiwanese multi-si cells’s quote was $0.30/w and Chinese multi-si cells were $0.29/W. Mono-si PV cells’ quote has decreased 0.52% to an average price of $0.38/W. PV modules’ price remained almost the same with last week; the modest swing prices were for market adjustment.

A recent study by the International Energy Agency states that the Asia-Pacific region ranks in first place in the amount of PV system installed for two years in a row. EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, projects that the total amount of PV installed worldwide in 2015 will reach 51.4GW in its newest PV Gold Report. The same report also predicts Asia-Pacific will continue to be ahead of other regions in the amount of PV installed in 2015, accounting for 60% and above globally. China in particular will represent 35% of world’s PV market with its estimated installed capacity at 17.8GW. In sum, demands in China exert a lot of influence on the price movements in the PV industry.
EnergyTrend’s analyst Angus Kao said that in the second quarter, demands in China’s PV market have stabilized and there are signs that indicate the general decline in prices will end. Furthermore, the amount of orders for the downstream sector has picked up since the start of April, and the noticeable increases in orders also signal a stronger drive for downstream companies to stock up. There is a visible rise in the demand for high-efficiency products, now representing approximately 50% or more of the total PV market demand. Moreover, multi-Si cells with 17.8% efficiency have become the mainstream in the second quarter.
EnergyTrend’s research indicates the prices of polysilicon are unlikely to rise in the second quarter, and demands will determine whether the prices will stabilize or keep falling. This is because polysilicon manufacturers in the upstream sector have overcome their respective production bottleneck and will be expanding their capacities, thus making the feedstock plentiful. 
With polysilicon abundant, demands for wafers of high quality from the downstream sector in the second quarter are stronger than the first. The prices for wafers will be determined by whether the prices for polysilicon will continue to fall. Spot prices for polysilicon and wafer in March have dropped to levels not seen since Europe implemented tariffs on PV imports in 2011 and the US taking similar measures in 2012. Wafer manufactures thus hope prices will stabilize as demands pick up. Presently, the declines in multi-Si wafers are starting to ease.
Cell manufacturers in the second quarter are still watching the market, so they are unwilling to slash their prices. The recent spot market for PV cells will therefore show some narrow price fluctuations. With feed-in tariff programs around the world becoming more well-defined, the uncertainties that companies in the downstream sector face have been significantly reduced. This will also create observable demands for PV cells as well as boosting the capacity utilization rates for all parts of the supply chain. The PV cell prices may stop falling at the same time of returning demands, but chances of prices going up will depend on the rate of demand and the situation with getting rid of excess capacity.
As for PV module prices, they vary according to manufacturers. Prices are relatively stable for manufacturers that have downstream businesses operations (i.e. running PV systems) because they have reliable distribution channels. Those companies that only make and sell PV modules will have to compete for projects in a market that has an abundant supply. They will face the downward pressure on module prices.
This Week’s Spot Prices
PV prices continue to reflect a downtrend this week. Polysilicon spot prices dropped 1.18%, with the average price reaching $16.7/kg; Super high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices remained flat at an average of $0.895/piece; High-efficiency multi-si wafer prices declined 0.24% to $0.848/piece; Mono-si wafer prices dropped 0.76% to $1.05/piece.
Although cell utilization rates have begun to increase, cell prices remained weak. High-efficiency multi-si cell prices slightly dropped 0.65% to $0.308/w. Multi-si cell prices in Taiwan decreased 0.68% to $0.298/w and that in China dropped to $0.29/w. Mono-si cell prices dropped 0.53% to $0.378/w. Module prices didn’t have significant changes compared to last week. 250W multi-si module prices slightly dropped 0.18% to $0.548/w. Price quotes for 265W mono-si module was $0.609/w.

                                Water Scarcity Issue in Taiwan Boosts Local PV Cell Production Costs                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150416-8594.html,"









Water scarcity issue in Taiwan has begun to affect some of the local cell manufacturers. If cell manufacturers decide to purchase water, cell production costs will increase.
This week, polysilicon prices remained low due to less polysilicon shipment. But the overall supply chain prices are expected to turn stable. In order to avoid high inventory level, some Chinese polysilicon makers have planned to reduce capacities. Three to four of them may conduct maintenance during this time. Basically, monthly capacity will lower about 400-1000 tons, but it will have limited effect on polysilicon suppliers. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers have started to receive more wafer orders, leading to stable wafer supply and demand. As tier-one wafer makers refuse to lower the prices further, Chinese makers hope to raise the prices after demand increases.
Due to water scarcity issues, some Taiwan manufacturers were forced to reduce capacities or suspend productions on the days of water outage. If water scarcity issues continue to worsen, some cell manufacturers may have to purchase additional water. However, current water prices have doubled or tripled, hence, even if manufacturers purchase water, they still can’t run at full capacity, leading to higher unit production costs. EnergyTrend projected that Taiwan cell production cost will increase 3%-5% if severe water shortage occurs later on. Therefore, Taiwan manufacturers must be aware of whether the situation gets worse or not. In the meantime, although manufacturers have considered raising cell prices to reflect the costs, prices may not go up. Chinese cell manufacturers have been trying to raise multi-si cell prices following the uptick in demand. Yet, they haven’t actually done so as the situation remains unstable. Chinese cell prices may reflect an uptrend if costs will go up and demand will increase in the future.
Mono-si module demand was weaker, with the prices reflecting a downtrend. Multi-si module’s power plant demand increased, leading to stable prices. Overall, module manufacturers are positive about the future market trend. Some module manufacturers indicated that they believe demand will grow significantly after Shanghai SNEC.

At this year’s SNEC tradeshow, many PV module manufacturers and PV system developers focused on prompting their solar projects. With optimistic outlook of demand for both ground-mounted and distributed generation projects, exhibitors at 2015 SNEC attempted building channels to boost their sales. Stronger demand for PV projects represents more orders to the PV supply chain as well. First- and second-tire manufacturers will opt for different business strategies depending on whether they directly own and build PV projects.
The 2015 SNEC convention took place in Shanghai, China, one of the world’s largest PV market. EnergyTrend found the appearance of local demands for solar projects in the tradeshow. PV system developers continue prompting PV projects, while PV module vendors hope to build channels for securing their module sales. The demand for PV module after the tradeshow would be stronger than in the first quarter as the construction of PV projects will be started gradually. To fulfill the foreseen demand, PV module manufacturers would raise their module backlogs up to at least 0.5 month volume. Most PV module manufacturers that are developing PV projects are running at 100% capacity utilization rate; meanwhile, second-tier manufacturers are utilizing their production capacity according to the volume of their OEM orders.
Although the downstream demand has revived, PV spot prices of upstream products remained flat subsequent to previous months. The main reason for the flat price trend is the surplus supply of polysilicon. The Chinese customs information shows that the import volume of polysilicon in March 2015 hit 10,297 tons, 36.2% higher than March 2014. The polysilicon import in the first quarter of 2015 also increased 26.5% to 27,164 tons comparing to 1Q14. In addition, polysilicon manufacturers added more production capacities in the same period, which worsened the surplus stock that can’t be consumed. PV demand is traditionally weak in the first quarter, and the excessive supply of polysilicon caused the price downturn of upstream PV supply chain. With more PV projects to be built, upstream vendors look forward to more shipment to the downstream sector so that they can consume their polysilicon stock.
Beside, utilization rate of PV cells raised from April because of stronger demand to PV modules. However, spot price of PV cells and wafers decreased to represent the decline of raw materials of polysilicon.
This Week’s Spot Prices
Quote of polysilicon slightly dropped 0.62% to US$16.1/kg. Quote of high-efficiency multi-si wafer dropped 0.6% to US$0.835/piece, while the average price of mono-si wafer decreased to US$1.02/piece.

China’s domestic PV demand continues to rise in May. Hence, the leading PV companies are now expanding their businesses into the downstream sector, focusing on PV system in particular. This in turn drives the capacity expansion efforts along the entire supply chain, according to EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce.
EnergyTrend’s analyst Angus Kao said leading, vertically integrated PV companies such as Canadian Solar and Trina are expanding their capacities mainly by outsourcing. Their secondary method is to work with medium and small-size manufacturers of cells and modules. Investing in their own capacities is considered to be their last resort. The leading PV companies are also tightening their hold of the downstream channels by setting up system service companies that would allocate the end demand back to them. On the other hand, the system market is also receiving new entrants that aim to capitalize on the future growth of China’s rooftop PV systems. They include major Si wafer manufacturers like China-based GCL and LONGi. Presently, these players from the Si wafer industry are not only adding their mono- and multi-Si wafer capacities, but they are also taking on many system projects. The aggressive expansion into the downstream will secure market shares and channels. Moreover, this strategy will reduce risks for the PV solution providers and accelerate their positioning efforts in the market.
Many companies have seen positive results of branching out into different business models within the industry. However, Kao points out that the fiscal reports show profits for modules have plummeted while the overall revenues have reached record high. The industry’s biggest worry right now is still the ongoing price declines in the downstream market due to excess capacities.
Cell manufacturers ready to raise their prices as demands return 
The spot prices for polysilicon remain weak since China’s polysilicon imports rose in the first quarter, resulting in a glut. According to EnergyTrend’s estimation, China has nearly two months’ worth of stock. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the reduction of polysilicon stock will accelerate as the leading PV companies are preparing for the coming system projects. On the whole, the average polysilicon spot price for May is projected to be within the range of US$15-16/kg.
Si wafer prices are expected to fall in May, with the high-efficiency multi-Si wafers to be around US$0.80-0.81/pc. Falling polysilicon prices and calls from clients (who have experienced losses) have pushed down the prices for multi-Si wafers. The prices for mono-Si wafers also continue to fall in correlation with polysilicon prices and lack of visible rise in demand. Currently, the leading PV companies are the main support of the Si wafer demands, albeit indirectly by outsourcing cell manufacturing for their system integration projects.
PV cell manufacturers, which have seen fiscal losses, are also ready to raise their prices in anticipation of the returning demands. Cell manufacturers will likely to increase product prices to the point where they are able to recover cash costs. The average price in May for high-efficiency multi-Si cells from China and Taiwan will hold steady around US$0.295-0.31/w. However, multi-Si cells outside of this category have seen their demands dropping steadily this month. Their average price will fluctuate narrowly in the low range of US$0.28-0.29/w.
Prices stay relatively stable in the PV module market. The top-tier module makers are nearly loaded in their capacities and are sending orders to the second- and third-tier manufacturers. Thus, module prices for May will be not much different from April and any changes will be mainly linked to the prices of polysilicon, Si wafers and PV cells.

                                Solar Industrial Concentration to Become Higher through Consolidation                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150522-8815.html,"









As the global PV market is heating up, the solar industry synchronously enters into another consolidation period. While some solar PV companies has been struggling for financial crisis, profited and stable ones seize the opportunity to expand their market share through expanding production capacity, invest in new technology or merging with other manufacturers. Large companies would become even larger in the future, expects EnergyTrend.
Supply of polysilicon is the focus of the upstream PV supply chain in this year. Starting from 2015, the increasingly excessive supply of polysilicon has caused a spot price downturn in the supply chain. As a result, the bankruptcy of Taiwan Polysilicon Corporation will have no severe impact on Taiwanese and global PV supply chain because wafer manufacturers are accessible to polysilicon with lower costs.
Many international polysilicon manufacturers are expanding their production capacity with optimistic outlook for the future demand. Wacker now have 20,000 MT of annual capacity, OCI has debottlenecked and added 10,000 MT of supply, while Hanwha Chemical also added 3,000 to 5,000 MT of new polysilicon production capacity. Tokuyama’s Malaysian plant, a facility that has an annual capacity of 13,800 MT, has started massive production, and the utilization rate in 2015 is expected to reach 70%. In China, volume of polysilicon keeps soaring. GCL will add 25,000 MT of polysilicon, TBEA and Daqo both plan to add 3,000-6,000 MT of production volume. YongXiang Co. Ltd. also targets to increase its polysilicon production capacity by 10,000 MT in 2015. The additional production capacity is already higher than 70,000 MT, enough for producing 12-13GW of PV modules. As a result, the surplus supply of polysilicon will remain for a period.
In the midstream part of the supply chain, larger PV cell manufacturers stay on their vantage as well. Motech and TSi’s merger is the headline of recent PV cell manufacturing industry, and the merger will become effective in June 1st. In the meantime, many large makers continues expanding their production lines. For example, JA Solar, JinkoSolar and Trina Solar has already established, respectively, 400~700MW of additional PV cell production capacity in Malaysia or Thailand. Panasonic announced to invest US$80 million in adding capacity to next generation HIT high efficiency solar cells/modules because of the bright outlook for Japanese residential market as well as on the basis of the well performance of solar segment.
PV companies who have advanced technology and who seize the distribution channel will be more profitable in the future. In this wave of consolidation, these companies will improve efficiency and quality of their products, and will reduce costs by massive production or building exclusive distribution channels. These methods could help them become more competitive among their rivals.
This week’s spot prices
During this week, quote of polysilicon remained flat. The average quote slightly dropped 0.31% down to US$16/kg. The reduced price and surplus supply of polysilicon caused a decline to quotes of multi-si wafers. High efficiency multi-si wafers’ spot prices decreased to US$0.825/piece. Likewise, mono-si wafers’ spot price also dropped because the supply was not able to be consumed even though the demand was stronger in this week.
In terms of spot prices of PV cells, stronger demand to high efficiency multi-si cells successfully stopped the downturn, the quote rose to US$0.303/W. However, standard multi-si PV cells’ quote continued dropping due to sufficient supply. Taiwan-made multi-si cells’ spot price was US$0.289/W, while China-made ones was US$0.287/W.
PV module orders from overseas markets and abroad shipment has increased in this week, yet the demands are becoming polarized. Market demands to high output and low-cost modules both increased. Consequently, 250W multi-si PV modules’ spot price slightly dropped 0.93% to US$0.52/W. 265W standard mono-si PV modules’s quote slightly decreased 0.17% to US$0.6/W due to flat market demand.

                                Financing Mechanisms to Accelerate PV Plant Development                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150528-8844.html,"









Different financing platforms have started to pop up since the end of 2014, such as online financial & leasing services set up by individual companies, government financial services, green financial products, and YieldCo which has been a very popular topic recently. All of the financing mechanisms are expected to stimulate the momentum for power plant development.
Online financing platform has been a hot topic in China these years. For example, SPI introduced a solar financial leasing product called “Solarbao.com” and a B2B e-commerce platform called “Solartao.com” this year; Jinko Solar launched an online loan service with Shanghai, Haining Zhejiang, and Jiangxi; CGN also came up with “PVbao.net” this year to provide solar financial products with return rate of 13%. “PVbao.net” is actually the first internet banking platform established by the Central Bank of China, leading to consumer boom. In addition, YieldCo is another choice as well, and thus there are all kinds of ways to finance PV plants.
Speaking of YieldCo, it is a dividend growth-oriented public company, created by a parent company, that bundles conventional long-term contracted operating assets in order to generate predictable cash flows. This investment can be attractive to shareholders because they can expect low-risk returns (or yields) that are projected to increase over time.
PV Solar Project Development and Financial Needs
After EPC/developers acquire the land and PPA, they will move on to construction and procurement phases. During this time, short-term financing is required. Upon the completion of the power plants, the owners can request for long-term financing from banks, while pay back previously borrowed short-term loan. If the power plant is successfully connected to the grid at the end, it won’t have to deal with any financing shortage issues.
However, all of the following are risks – Will the power plant construction and grid-connection go smoothly? Will power supply be stable after connecting to the grid? Will the amount of power generation meet the expectation? Will subsidy be on schedule? If one of the processes is postponed, the owners may not get long-term financing from banks, leading to financial shortages. This is also the greatest challenge for downstream construction. But with a variety of financing mechanisms coming out, it will stimulate the growth of power plants and reduce the financing issues for system manufacturers.
Lately, Canadian Solar announced to put low-risk projects from the US, UK, Canada, and Japan in the YieldCo. The company anticipates the IPO may be available on a US Stock Exchange in 2H15; Neo Solar Power (NSP) is going to invest US$50 million in the YieldCo. In other words, financing capability will be another key indicator to channels, hence it’s worth follow up on these financing products.
This Week’s Spot Prices
Polysilicon prices dropped 1.25% to US$15.8/kg. Fluctuation can be seen in wafer prices - Super high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices declined 0.35% to US$0.857/piece due to weaker demand; high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices dropped 0.24%; mono-si wafer prices continued to decline 0.5% to US$1.005/piece, with the average price reaching US$0.823/piece. High-efficiency multi-si cell prices increased 0.33% to US$0.304/w because of stronger demand. Basically, multi-si cell prices remained flat in both Taiwan and China as multi-si cell demand increased. But mono-si cell prices dropped 1.37% to US$0.36/w due to less demand. Module prices remained flat following stable demand. 250w multi-si module price was US$0.53/w and US$0.6/w for 265w mono-si module.

                                PV Cell Manufacturers to Raise Prices in June Due to High Order Visibility                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150604-8886.html,"

 








 
After going through five-months of downturn, PV industry is back on track in June as new polysilicon and high-efficiency cell orders pour in. Most tier-one cell manufacturers sold out the existing capacities, therefore they will raise sale prices in June to compensate for the losses in 1Q15.
Starting from the end of May, capacity utilization rates increased substantially for cell manufacturers, according to EnergyTrend’s investigation. Manufacturers indicated that many rush orders could be seen in the beginning of June and tier-one cell manufacturers almost sold out existing high-efficiency cell capacities in June. Since high-efficiency cell prices dropped about 10% in 1Q15, cell makers suffered from losses. Thus, cell makers begin to raise prices after they are certain that they are getting demand from the customers, hoping to increase 17.8% high-efficiency cell prices by more than 3%. Yet, they are still negotiating with the end-users. As for normal-grade cells, oversupply issues still exist because improving demand caused tier-two Chinese makers to re-activate the productions, leading to weak prices.
Overall, downstream demand growth will only affect midstream cell manufacturers. It will have limited impact on upstream wafer manufacturers. Hence, there is more room for wafer capacity adjustment. Aside from the allocated capacity for the OEM, market pressures caused by selling too many multi-si wafers can be avoided. However, many capacities are still being sold at spot prices in the market, leading to oversupply issues for wafers. Wafer prices will also continue to decline as polysilicon prices drop.
This Week’s Spot Price
Polysilicon market prices kept declining due to high level of inventory. Polysilicon prices dropped 1.27% to US$15.6/kg. Super high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices dropped 0.58% to US$0.852/piece, while high-efficiency multi-si wafer declined 0.61% to US$0.818/piece. Mono-si wafer prices remained at US$1.005/piece. The increase in high-efficiency multi-si cell demand led to 0.66% rise in prices, with the average prices reaching US$0.306/w. Mono-si cell prices declined 0.28% to US$0.359/w. 250w multi-si module prices stayed flat at US$0.53/w and US$0.6/w for 265w modules.

                                Chinese Lithium Cell Makers Ride on Back of Domestic Smartphone Brands’ Rise                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150610-8912.html,"

The latest research from EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, finds the shipments of Chinese branded smartphones have risen sharply in the past four years, with the 2015 shipments expected to grow by 11.6% year on year. Set against the previous year’s growth rate of 20%, this year’s projected shipment result is much less impressive even though it still reflects steady growth. Moreover, Chinese brands now controls a nearly 40% share of the global smartphone market, and their rise causes a corresponding shift in the sourcing of components, including batteries. Previously, the mainstream suppliers for handset batteries are from Japan and South Korea, but now the primary suppliers are Chinese companies and the Koreans assume the supporting position. Japanese cell makers in contrast focus on developing the power battery application. Chinese brand manufacturers of handset batteries thus have gradually reached the top tier of the supply chain by riding on the growth of domestic smartphone brands. Currently, Chinese lithium cell makers control over 60% of the home market for handset batteries.
“The rise of Chinese smartphone brands began when they built themselves up in the domestic market a few years ago,” said EnergyTrend’s Research Manager Duff Lu. “Once they were strong enough they expanded internationally, also taking opportunities to introduce Chinese made components at the same time.” Chinese branded lithium batteries benefitted greatly from this arrangement in terms of the market visibility and have seen rapid growth in their market shares in recent years. Recognized China-based suppliers of handset batteries for global smartphone brands include Amperex Technology, Lision Technology, Shenzhen Desay Battery Technology, Sunwoda Electronic and Coslight Technology International Group. These companies have established themselves as top tier suppliers in the international lithium battery market.
Before this wave of handset-driven growth, Chinese lithium battery makers had a short boom period during 2008-2010, when they entered the global supply chain via the notebook application market. At that time, the lithium battery market was rocked by reports of accidents that stirred doubts about the safety of lithium cell products. The bad news also created a supply shortage that Japanese and South Korean battery manufacturers were unable to alleviate. Their Chinese competitors tried to use the situation to propel themselves internationally and all together rushed into the notebook market. However, the South Korean manufacturers made an unexpectedly quick recovery and were able to steadily pushed Chinese-made lithium cells for notebooks out competition in less than a year with well-honed price manipulation tactics. Therefore, the most pressing issue for Chinese lithium cell makers this time around is to seize the opportunities that come from their enlarged presence in the handset battery market and extend their gains.

                                Improvement in Conversion Efficiency Upgrades Definition of Mainstream PV Modules to 255W                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150612-8938.html,"









Conversion efficiency of PV products keeps improving. Accordingly, China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) has set new criteria for “high efficiency PV products.” Power output of 60-cell multi-si PV modules is required to reach 255W, while the requirement for high efficiency mono-si PV modules is 260W. Products with efficiency higher than the criteria will enjoy additional support.
In NEA’s 2015 announcement No.194 (No. 194), the new requirements for multi-si and mono-si PV cells’ conversion efficiencies are respectively 15.5% and 16%. According to these indexes, power output of 60-cell PV modules shall be higher than respectively 255W and 260W. The new indexes have become effective since June 1st. Furthermore, NEA keeps prompting the ""Top Runner Program,"" which encourages PV projects to use products with advanced technology and better performance. PV projects utilizing PV modules consisting of multi-si PV cells with efficiency higher than 16.5%, or mono-si cells with efficiency higher than 17%, will enjoy priority to construct, build or operate demonstration PV sites or to demonstrate innovative applications. The efficiency thresholds designated by the Pilot Program indicate even higher standards of 60-cell PV modules – 270W power out for multi-si modules and 275W for mono-si modules. Most manufacturers are happy to see the new indexes.
Many PV manufacturers continue improving power efficiency of PV products. So far, it is easy to see 60-cell multi-si Pv modules with power output ranging between 255W to 260W. PV manufacturers with strong technology have already unveiled multi-si PERC PV modules with power output as high as 275W to 280W, which is higher than No.194’s requirements. The new definition and supportive policy for high efficiency products will be effective on PV projects approved in the second half of 2015. Thus, the announcement of No. 194 will not have any impact on this year’s full-year demand.
PV manufacturers that are unable to satisfy the new requirement will be eliminated from the PV industry, while makers with better technology or research abilities will be able to keep improving. Most insiders regard the new definition as a helpful policy to create a healthier industry environment.
This week’s spot prices
The PV supply chain’s supply and demand became more balanced during the past week, yet the surplus supply of polysilicon remained. Although polysilicon vendors longed for clearing backlog through the stronger demand, but it is not as expected. Some Chinese polysilicon manufacturers therefore are planning to develop solar power plant to create more channels for selling their polysilicon products. As a result, quote of polysilicon dropped 0.64% to US$15.5/kg.
Spot prices of wafers fluctuated during this week. The first-tier wafer manufacturers tried to stabilize the price downturn, but second-tier manufacturers reduced their spot prices. High efficiency multi-si wafers’ spot price slightly decreased 0.37% down to US$0.815/piece, and mono-si wafer’s spot price remained at US$1.005/piece.
Quote of high efficiency multi-si PV modules raised 0.33% to US$0.307/W thanks to continuous orders and strong demand to high efficiency products. Quotes of standard multi-si PV cells made in Taiwan and China both increased, respectively up to US$0.29/W and US$0.288/W.
Stronger demand for constructing large-scale PV power plants infused into demand for PV modules, leading to rise of average spot prices. On basis of the new definition of standard/high efficiency PV modules, 260W multi-si PV modules’ spot price was US$0.535/W, and 270~275W mono-si PV modules’ spot price was US$0.61/W.

                                Strong Downstream Demands Cause Spot Prices along PV Supply Chain to Rebound                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150618-8970.html,"









The latest photovoltaic (PV) price update by EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, shows the downstream sector of the industry has been seeing brisk orders since the start of June. Stock up demands for this month also starts to pick up following this turnaround.
“In China, domestically produced polysilicon has reached a low of 113~115 yuan RMB per kilogram in June because of the excess stock in the market,” said Angus Kao, analyst for EnergyTrend. “The import prices for polysilicon in China are actually lower and this causes additional price declines for domestic polysilicon. While the average selling price is still above production costs, manufacturers also have to contend with other costs, including inventory and operation. A huge pressure is on them because they cannot stay profitable unless they have achieved a sufficient scale of production.”
Consequently, polysilicon manufacturers are considering investing in PV system projects in the downstream sector in order to expand the client base. Some companies plan to build ground-mounted systems on lands that are originally set aside for plant expansion. Others intend to create a power plant company in the second half of this year, so they can attract capital for PV power plant projects and capacity expansion of polysilicon. Numerous Chinese polysilicon manufacturers presently have a department dedicated to the development of PV power plants. All these indicate that controlling the end market has become more important than capacity expansion.
Si wafer prices generally remained flat towards the end of May, but the situation has changed since June. Mono-Si manufacturers that have started to work on power plant projects in the downstream sector are seeing some early benefits. Their oversupply problem has been moderated, with the average price drop-off shrinking from 5.7% in the first quarter to about 1% in May. For the multi-Si wafer manufacturers, those at the first tier are better at filling their capacities and their priorities have been on supplying long-term clients. The second-tier manufacturers are raising their capacity utilization rates by both taking orders from the first-tier companies and spot trading. They generally are still having excess capacities, however, and multi-Si wafer prices are kept low as a result. On the whole, Si wafer manufacturers are reacting to the oversupply of polysilicon that caused price declines in the previous quarter. The slide in prices may be halted if the downstream sector are able to offer constant demands from June onwards. EnergyTrend estimates the average price of multi-Si wafers in June will be around US$0.80~0.81 per piece.
In the downstream sector, the prices of high-efficiency multi-Si cells stopped their decline in mid-May and started to rebound at the beginning of June due to the market turnaround. Manufacturers at the first tier were the first to raise prices. Overall, the prices for PV cells are rising and the market will continue to grow stronger. The current upswing is due to the fact that the 260W modules are becoming more mainstream, and this spurs the demands for cells of higher efficiency. The arrival of the peak season also gives a boost to the entire market. According to EnergyTrend, the average price of high-efficiency multi-Si cells will increase to US$0.31~0.33 per watt in June. However, the actual prices among manufacturers are going to vary according to the quality of their products and tariff rates imposed by the U.S.
The prices of modules have benefitted from the returning orders, and the first-tier manufacturers are fully loaded in their capacities. The capacity utilization levels for the second-tier companies are stabilizing owing to the orders from the first tier, though they also sell their own modules. The second-tier companies are also starting to expand into the system market because having more sales channels will ensure steady shipments. Before their plans fully realized, however, they still have to consider their present shipments and costs. The average module price therefore is expected to go up slightly by about 1%, a relatively moderate increase compared with other PV products.

                                Tesla’s Cost-Friendly Energy Storage System Takes Entire Battery Industry to A New Level                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150703-9044.html,"


Earlier in May, American electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc. made a splash in the energy sector when it revealed a new type of lithium battery packs for home and enterprise applications. Tesla touted its new line of energy storage systems, known as Power Wall, would fundamentally change the way the world uses energy and get the world’s consumption of power down to zero carbon levels. The Powerwall has two models: one with 7 kWh for day use and the other with 10 kWh for backup. The retail prices for these systems at most would not go over USD 3,500. As for enterprise clients, Tesla offers Powerpack, a bigger version of Powerwall with 100 kWh capacity. “Tesla’s new power storage units for home use are cost-effective for consumers,” said Duff Lu, research manager for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. “We therefore can expect similar products to take off following the drive that the Powerwall has created with its market entry.”
PV systems working in conjunction with energy storage systems are the most popular type of project in the new energy market right now. EnergyTrend projects the market scale for this kind of energy storage systems will climb rapidly from 226 MWh in 2015 to 1,628 MWh in 2018. Furthermore, the market growth for household energy storage systems will surpass that of the industrial and enterprise applications. In the future, energy storage systems will become more available in both household and industrial applications (including uses in the new energy sector).
According to Lu, demands in the energy storage market in general has steadily risen because of the following factors:
1. The current demand for batteries are ever-increasing because of the widespread use of various consumer electronic products.
	2. The feed-in tariff (FiT) rates for electricity generated by PV systems are lowered yearly worldwide, but the retail electricity prices remain high.
	3. The power generation industry has increased its overall conversion efficiency, and this in turn has also lifted the market demand for energy storage application.
	4. Energy storage systems are presently seeing a steady price drop.
Currently, energy storage systems for home use have been promoted and supported by government programs around the world. Japan, Germany, the United States and China have in turn created subsidy schemes for energy storage products. For instance, the latest FiT program announced by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry gives preference to the under-10kW PV installations that come with an energy storage system. The FiT rate for them is set higher at JPY 35/kWh because they can provide backup power and be configured for peak shaving. However, PV systems that are without energy storage systems have a reduced rate of JPY 33/kWh. Consequently, batteries will become a necessary feature in electricity generation systems for self-consumption because they will prevent surplus power from being wasted. Energy storage systems also offer the advantage of grid-tied electricity generation systems to sell excess capacity. Such cases include Japan’s electricity buyback program, which many countries will likely to emulate.
The United States’ renewable sector is expected to reach 70GW generation capacity by 2020. By that time, California aims to have 33% of its energy from renewable installations. Taking account that 3~5% of the United States’ renewable capacity in 2020 will be used for power backup, the country’s total demand for energy storage systems to complement the installation target will be about 2~3.5 GW. Furthermore, California Public Utilities Commission has recently passed a related law that mandates the state’s top three power companies to add at least 1.325 GW of energy storage by the end of the decade. In sum, California’s policies will drive the developments of large-scale energy storage systems in the near future.
Lu further notes industries in China’s renewable energy sector are seeing accelerated growths, and they all complement developments in energy storage systems. These include grid-tied projects, distributed generation projects, micro-grids and plug-in vehicles. The market for energy storage systems in China is still in its early phase with lead-acid batteries being the mainstream products. The scale of the country’s energy storage installations currently in operation is above 50MW. Wind turbine systems represent the largest proportion in China’s renewable sector, but nearly 10% of power that they generate is lost because these wind turbine systems have not been optimized and are not tied with an energy storage system. Demands are also turning up for distributed generation and micro-grid solutions. They encompass the electrification of rural communities, renewable systems for coastal islands and other rooftop PV system projects. On the whole, China is different from other markets that mainly cater to household or industrial demands. The country’s diverse environments offer opportunities in many applications.

                                Solar Installation in the First Quarter of 2015 Exceeded 12GW, Globally                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150703-9045.html,"









In the first quarter of 2015, more than 12GW of solar installations were added globally, according to EnergyTrend’s research. The forecasted 52GW annual demand is likely to be achieved, and installations in China, USA and Japan will represent up to 63% of the global installing capacity.
EnergyTrend’s Golden Member Report shows that China, USA, Japan and India are the top five PV markets in 2015, and the first three countries will install more than 60% of the global capacity. The Chinese market is expected to continue growing in 2015 and lead the world’s solar increase. Simply in the first quarter, its nationwide installations, which broke record, reached 5.04GW. The annual goal of 17.8GW seems more reasonable for China to accomplish. Japan, on the other hand, has installed 1950MW of solar capacity during the same period despite the government has been reducing certain subsidies for PV systems. It represents that the demand in Japan remains strong. Moreover, USA added 1306MW of new solar capacity in the quarter, representing 51% of the nation’s newly added power generating capacity – solar installations exceeded conventional electricity resources in the U.S. for the first time.
In the Americas, some countries other than USA will further ramp up their solar installing capacity in 2015. Chile, Honduras and Uruguay are regarded as leaders in the Latin America because they are projected to perform stronger demand.
Furthermore, EnergyTrend found that UK will retain the crown in the European solar market in 2015. Driven by Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs), the official solar installation in the first quarter of 2015 was as high as 1285MW, the highest volume in UK’s history. Nonetheless, it is necessary to see whether the future demand will be sustained because ROCs has been terminated by the end of March. On contrary, Germany, the previous leader of the European market, has only installed 319MW in the quarter. Reduced FiT subsidies and near-saturated market accounted for the decline of solar installations. Besides, France has passed a new regulation to require owners of buildings which are newly constructed in commercial zones to grow plants or install solar panels on the rooftops. Such kind of compulsive regulations would help accelerate renewable energy development in France.
India is the most attractive market among the emerging ones, as well as the most anticipated market aside from China. In the first quarter of 2015, 1100MW of new solar capacity has been added, so the annual target of 3GW is believed to be achieved. South Korea, another Asian market, dropped everyone’s jaw as it completed almost 200MW of solar projects. Australia’s solar installation in the same quarter was estimated 133MW.
Summarizing the installations of the top 10 markets, the total solar installation in the first quarter has reached 11.5GW, sharing almost 22% of the annual forecast. Taking installation capacity in minor markets into account, the global solar installation in the quarter exceeded 12GW. Accordingly, EnergyTrend is optimistic for the 52GW annual expectation.
This Week’s Spot Price
This week’s quotations of polysilicon differentiated in source regions. In China, spot price of polysilicon slightly raised 0.64% to US$15.7/kg, while quotes of polysilicon manufactured outside China were generally lower than the price. Quotes of multi-si wafers climbed due to stronger demand to high efficiency products, up 0.12% to US$0.818/W. In contrast to multi-si wafers, demand to mono-si wafers was flat so the spot price declined 1% down to US$0.31/W.
Standard multi-si PV cells’ spot price remained as the previous week.
Multi-si 260W PV modules’ spot price increased 0.19% to US$0.563/W because of higher raw material prices and stronger demand from the downstream market. Mono-si PV modules’ spot price stuck at US$0.61/W.

                                China and Taiwan PV Companies will Realize 4.5GW of PV Cell Capacity in 2015                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150717-9126.html,"

The final ruling of U.S.’s review of 2012 anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) against certain Chinese PV cells addressed the importance of PV capacities in countries out of China and Taiwan. The AD/CVD rates for PV cells and the cost of PV modules will be crucial for PV manufacturers which aim to increase their market share in the U.S. market, and the demand in the U.S. will influence the future price trend. EnergyTrend estimates that Taiwan’s and China’s PV cell manufacturing capacity in third-party counties will cumulatively reach 4.5GW by the end of 2015, and the currently upward price trend could also be restricted.
The new AD/CVD tariffs on PV cells formed new thresholds for Chinese and Taiwanese PV exporters. To manufacturers with limited cash, the heavy tariffs create barriers for them to export PV products to the U.S. market. It is necessary for those who are trying to increase their market shares in the U.S. market to make PV modules with tax-free cells in the third countries – only by doing so, the module prices could be lower than PV modules using Taiwan- or China-made cells. As a result, the PV cell production capacity in the third countries again grabbed the attention of cross-strait PV manufacturers. Factors such as, if the PV cell production capacity in the third countries will be enough to satisfy the demand in the U.S. market, and when the full capacity will be realized, will all cause changes in the PV cells’ price trend in the second half of 2015.
According to EnergyTrend’s research, several Chinese and Taiwanese PV manufacturers have started deploying new producing lines in Asian regions such as Southeastern Asia and South Korea. Simply in these regions, the additional PV cell production capacity is estimated to reach 4.5GW (capacity in India excluded), which will be sufficient for the U.S. market. As a result, the supply and demand in the U.S. would be balanced as long as all the capacity were realized as projected. The balance will also indicate to a possible downturn of Taiwan- and China-made PV cells’ price trend.

This Week’s Spot Prices
In China, the domestic demand is expected to increase in the second half of 2015, driving a upward trend in polysilicon’s quotes. Polysilicon’s spot price increased 1.26% to US16.1/kg during the past week.
Demand to high efficiency multi-si wafers is also stronger than the previous weeks. First-tier multi-si wafer manufacturers are mostly under full producing capacity, and the spot prices slightly raised 0.36% to average US$0.825/piece. Nonetheless, orders for mono-si wafers remained flat as most of the demands are from in-house OEM needs. As a result, spot price of mono-si wafer slightly dropped 0.52% to US$0.959/piece.
Price trend of PV cells continued to climb during this week. The conclusion of U.S.’s 20132 AD/CVD tariffs review triggered a 0.32% rise for Taiwan-made high efficiency multi-si PV cells up to US$0.313/W. Taiwan-made multi-si PV cells’ spot price also increased 0.34% to US$0.293/W. In contrast, spot price of China-made multi-si PV cells stuck at US$0.289/W.
Spot prices of PV modules generally remained except modules that will be exported to the U.S. However, the price impact could be limited since only few first-tier manufacturers would ship their PV modules to the U.S. market and most of them will export the products from overseas plants. In China, on the other hand, the strong demand will further drive the price trend of PV modules. High efficiency multi-si 260W PV modules’ average quote was US$0.538/W, and the 270-275W mono-si PV modules’ spot price was US$0.61/W.

                                Mergers between PV Companies Driven by International Integration and Expansion Strategies                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150725-9170.html,"

Global PV industry has entered into a new chapter as several major mergers between international solar PV companies took place. Vertical or horizontal integrations are why PV companies merge with each other, and each company has to move depending on its own business strategies.
This Monday, SunEdison, a U.S.-based renewable energy company, and TerraForm Power announced to acquire Vivint Solar, a leader in U.S.’s residential solar market. One day later, SunEdison again declared that it will merge with one of UK’s leading home solar providers, Mark Group. In the meantime in Asia, China’s Tongwei Group announced to purchase 10% of shares in Gintech Energy, one of Taiwanese PV leaders. The international mergers between PV companies were mainly launched for higher profits and better global allocation. Instead of buying new equipment or establishing overseas manufacturing sites, companies with enough capital tend to turn to acquire, buy stocks, or merge with other companies to accelerate their allocations and deployment around the world.
M.K. Lu, Chairman & CEO of SAS, has pointed out that the future mergers between solar companies will be only for two objectives: to vertically integrate from upstream to downstream, or to horizontally integrate for scale expansion. Although different companies will choose diverse approaches, their destinations converge toward the same direction: reducing costs for being more profitable.
The major mergers and acquisition in 2014 and 2015 are:


Angus Kao, analyst at EnergyTrend, estimates that there will be only two to four solar PV companies lasted in Taiwan in the futhre. ASA acquired SUNRISE Global Solar Energy, Solartech and ALEO for vertical integration. In the contrary, mergers between Motech and TSi, and stock purchase by Tongwei from Gintech, are for expanding PV cells’ production capacity to maintain their superiority.
In the western market, mergers and acquisitions were not occasional. Companies with strong channel and sufficient capital like SunEdison and SolarCity have been merging with or acquiring PV module makers and solar system providers to optimize their services so that they can increase their ability to profit as well as expand their market shares.
In conclusion, PV companies that possess enough capital and sufficient resources will be seeking to expand their manufacturing scale and maximize operation efficiency by vertical and horizontal integrations. The integration and expansion will further strengthen the companies’ competiveness as the manufacturing costs could be significantly reduced.
This Week’s Spot Price
Stock of polysilicon was lowered during this week, yet the demand was weaker than last week. The quote of polysilicon remained as last week at US$16.1/kg.
Multi-si wafers’ prices slightly increased in the past week, while the average price of mono-si wafers was US$0.965/piece. First-tier multi-si wafer manufacturers that have signed to supply products to solar PV power plants were at full capacity, yet demand to mono-si wafers were flat.
In terms of PV cells’ spot prices, strong demand drives a upward trend. Super high efficiency multi-si PV cells’ spot price was stuck under a tension between providers and buyers. Taiwan-made multi-si PV cells’ average price slightly raised to US$0.294/W, while China-made multi-si cells’ price was US$0.289/W, the same with the price in the prior week.
Orders for PV modules were mostly from ground-mounted PV projects in China and from Japanese market. PV modules used on commercial distributed generation projects and residential systems were relatively weak at the moment because the constructions were launched later than ground-mounted large-scale PV projects in China. As a result, EnergyTrend projects a flat price trend of PV modules in the short term. High efficiency multi-si 260W modules’ spot price remained at US$0.538/W, and the quote of mono-si 270-275W modules were US$0.61/W, representing no difference from the price in the prior week.

                                China, USA and India Respectively Sets 100GW Solar Installation Goals                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150731-9198.html,"









In the recent, China, India and the U.S. unveiled ambitious solar installation targets up to 100GW. China targets to install a total of 100GW of solar by 2020, India sets an 100GW goal by 2022, while Hilary Clinton, a candidate of U.S.’s next president, announced to install 140GW of solar in her first term. The global solar market will be highly correlated with these bold policies.
China’s Twelfth Five-year Plan will be ended by 2015 with an anticipated solar installation totaling 45GW. The Thirtieth Five-year Plan is now under establishing, and EnergyTrend expects that the Chinese government would increase the solar installation target from approximately 20GW per year up to 30GW between 2016 and 2020. The cumulative installation could reach 170GW by 2020 if the anticipation were realized.
Hilary Clinton, the U.S.’s presidential candidate, unveiled her aggressive renewable energy policy. She aims to have 500 million solar panels installed across the U.S., and targets at powering all American homes with renewable resources by 2027. Her first policy represents an annual solar installation as high as 30GW from 2016 to 2020. If most of the solar arrays were installed atop rooftops, the solar panels will cover 30% rooftops of American buildings. As a result, how to carry out the policies will be the top issue for Hilary.
Aside from China and USA, India, a nation that her government established MNRE in early 2015, announced to add 100GW of solar power by 2022. India might rise as the world’s largest solar market in three years, the growth momentum should be seriously estimated.
According to EnergyTrend’s research, China’s and the U.S.’s market shares in 2015 would respectively reach 30% and 18%. Taking India’s 3.5GW installation projection into account, the total market share of the three countries will surpass 50% of the global demand in 2015. However, China is the only country that is highly possible to achieve its goal, said Angus Kao, analyst at EnergyTrend. The U.S. market should boost again after production capacity of high efficiency is enough for supplying demands of domestic rooftop markets. India’s solar market, on the other hand, will start to grow when issues include capital, gird infrastructure and local policy are all conquered.
It is predicable that the solar market in 2016 to 2017 will be different from the situation in 2014 and 2015 because of the switch of mainstream markets.
This Week’s Spot Price
During this week, supply and demand of polysilicon was balanced. Quote of China’s first-tier polysilicon was US$16.1/kg. In contrary, demand to high efficiency multi-si wafers was stronger, yet the average price remained flat. Spot price of multi-si wafer stuck at US$0.825/piece, while spot price of mono-si wafers dropped.
PV cells’ supply is sufficient, and demand to cells with conversion efficiency between 17.8% and 18% is stronger than other ones. Quote of high efficiency multi-si PV cells was US$0.313/W, and of Taiwan-made multi-si cells was US$0.294/W. Quote of China-made multi-si PV cells stuck at US$0.289/W.
As the price trend overall was flat during the week, prices of PV modules will be as smooth as prices of wafers and cells. High efficiency 260W multi-si PV modules’ spot price was US$0.538/W, and 270-275W mono-si PV modules’ quote was US$0.61/W, the same with in the last week.

Orders continued to stream into the photovoltaic (PV) market during the latter half of July, according the latest PV price report by EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. Besides China’s domestic demand being spurred by government policy, market demands remain strong across regions, including the United States, Japan and India. Capacity utilization rates continue to rise for all industry participants, and top-tier module manufacturers at downstream will see their capacities fully booked for at least the next three months. EnergyTrend anticipates that high demand will persist to the year’s end, but price increases will be somewhat limited.
""With demands becoming certain, the main factor dictating the prices along the supply chain in August will be China closing polysilicon process trade loophole,"" said Angus Kao, analyst at EnergyTrend. Polysilicon prices in China may stabilize and then rise when polysilicon imports diminish and demand picks up. Nonetheless, the downstream market will determine the extent of price increase, and prices have been mostly set for August’s downstream orders. Hence, the Chinese polysilicon market will not see a big price jump during this month. The increase will be around 2~3%, from the current price of RMB 116~118/kg to RMB 120/kg.
In the silicon wafer market, demand is shifting towards high-efficiency multi-Si wafer because of efficiency improvements made on PV modules. Since the orders for high-quality wafers have been brisk, the second- and third-tier wafer manufacturers have added their capacities into the production. Thus, wafer price increases have been limited. High-efficiency multi-Si wafers from top-tier manufacturers are expected to reach US$0.835/pc. However, the acceptable price range for most cell makers is between US$0.825/pc and US$0.83/pc. Wafer prices will be eventually decided by the extent of price increase in the raw material and end product markets. 
Furthermore, mono-Si wafer demand will be linked to the system products that are being developed by wafer manufacturers themselves. These projects will be able to consume a part of the overall mono-Si wafer capacity. The room for mono-Si wafer process is relatively large, so EnergyTrend predicts that prices will continue to fall in the mono-Si wafer market as to stimulate demand.
As for the cell market, demand has been strong for high-efficiency multi-Si products in August, with orders once again going to the second- and third-tier. However, module prices have hit the ceiling and there is an excess of cell capacity. Consequently, the price uptrend in the August cell market will be limited as well. Taiwanese high-efficiency cells is project to rise from US$0.31~0.315/W to US$0.313~0.318/W, and Chinese high-efficiency cells will rise from US$0.3~0.303/W to US$0.303~0.306/W. With a pending price hike on multi-Si wafers and cell production costs reaching US$0.30~0.31/W, a slight increase to cell prices will provide only a limited contribution to cell companies’ margins. Thus, the mid-stream of the supply chain is still struggling to maintain profitability.
Module prices are stable in the short term as the current mainstream modules have reached 255~260 W in efficiency level. Owing to high demand, the vertically integrated top-tier module companies in China will be able to maintain fully booked capacity for at least the next three months. Many orders have also be sent to the second- and third-tier module makers, which will keep the market well supplied with their capacities. EnergyTrend expects that module prices during August will not increase significantly, and instead the market will have small price fluctuations within a narrow and fixed range.
This Week's Spot Price
Downstream order visibility will be higher as peak-season approaches. Polysilicon manufacturers have started to increase prices, but most of the clients remain conservative and are waiting to see what will happen after China suspends the processing of applications for the polysilicon OEM trading business in August. Thus, the polysilicon trading price remained at US$16.1/kg.
Orders have poured in for high-efficiency multi-si wafers. Multi-si wafer prices have also begun to reflect an uptrend. This week’s multi-si spot price increased 0.36% to US$0.828/piece; mono-si price dropped to US$0.95/piece as mono-si wafer manufacturers hoped to get certain amount of orders.
Demand remained strong for cells with efficiency above 17.8%-18%. High-efficiency multi-si cell price increased 0.64% to US$0.315/W. Multi-si cell price in Taiwan declined 0.34% to US$0.295/W and that in China stay at US$0.289/W. Mono-si cell price dropped to US$0.348/W in China.
Module order visibility is high. But module prices will be difficult to increase due to long credit terms and tier-two manufacturers’ large production capacity. 260W high-efficiency multi-si module price remained at US$0.538/W, while 270W-275W mono-si module price stayed at US$0.61/W.

Mainstream PV products are currently struggling against sameness and virulent price competition. To become outstood over others, solar companies have to develop differentiated and competitive products. The trend is triggered by the EU’s announcement of a new project “X-GWp,” which aims to develop next generation N-type HIT PV cells. However, strategic allocation for downstream market is also vital for companies if they hope to maintain or upgrade their competitive advantages.
EU-made PV cells’ global market share had topped 25% in 2008, yet the ratio has dropped down to 7% in 2014 due to the emergence of China-made products. Although European makers predominate over fields include technology, research and equipment, higher production costs and lower manufacturing scales make less and less room for them to compete with Chinese makers. To break the deadlock, the EU launched its on-processing X-GWp project – the main objective of the project is to bring next generation high-efficiency (22% - 25%) c-Si N-type HIT PV cells to massive production. The project aims to set up a competitive gigawatt-scale production of PV cells and modules in Europe using a new generation of silicon-based technology and ensuring permanent innovation. As part of the project, EU plans to set a manufacturing facility with up to 1GW of N-type HIT PV products production capacity by 2017.
By 2017, the global production capacity of N-type cells could exceed 5GW, representing approximately 7% of global demand for PV cells, projected EnergyTrend.
Chinese first-tier PV manufacturers also take part in the efficiency rivalry. By the end of this July, Trina Solar unveiled the world’s first 6-inch large-sized IBC PV cells production line, which will produce PV cells with efficiency up to 21%. If the IBC cell’s production capacity were completely realized, EU’s N-type HIT cells might again be challenged by China-made low-cost PV products sicne 2017. Moreover, given facts that Japanese rooftop market is not as strong as expected, European market remains flat, and PERC will become the leader of mainstream products, it is uncertain whether the 2017 market would completely consume all these super high efficiency products or not. As a result, it will not be everything predicable for EU to win back its global market share only through the X-GWp project.
Furthermore, strategic allocation in the downstream market counts a lot for profits of manufactures -- and it can be more crucial than next generation technologies. SunPower and Panasonic, the only two manufacturers which produce super high efficiency PV cells (>22%), unveiled different financial results. SunPower’s gross margin was higher than Panasonic’s, and the superiority is from SunPower’s PV system business. The financial results show the importance of system-integrated business for the downstream market over cutting-edge technologies.

This Week’s Spot Prices
During the week, buyers of polysilicon were looking on the effects of China’s to-be-ended processing trade loopholes. The spot price consequently stuck at around US$16.1/kg.

China’s top-tier manufacturers have continually announced the financial results for the second quarter of 2015 (2Q15), in which, Trina Solar had the best performance. In 2Q15, Trina experienced strong growth in terms of shipment and revenue. Its gross margin even reached 20%. The key to Trina’s success in 2Q15 is its increasing use of high-efficiency products.
	Trina’s module shipment hit a new high in 2Q15, reaching 1.23GW, up 20% from last quarter and 30.6% QoQ. Revenue was US$722.9 million, a 29.5% rise QoQ and a 39.2% rise YoY. Meanwhile, Trina raised the module shipment target for 2015 from 4.4GW-4.6GW to 4.9GW-5.1GW, and 700MW-800MW of which aim to satisfy self-developed power plant demand. Thus, the new target will increase shipment by 33.9%-39.3% compare to 2014, showing that Trina is optimistic toward the future market demand.
	On the contrary, Canadian Solar’s shipment declined 21.5% QoQ to 809MW in 2Q15. Revenue was US$637 million, a 26% dip from the previous quarter. Gross margin was 15.2%, 17.8% lower than 1Q15. Another Chinese manufacturer, JA Solar, pointed out that its module shipment (including OEM) reached 717.4MW, up 22.8% from 1Q15 and 60.9% QoQ. Revenue was US$437 million, a 12.7% rise QoQ. Gross margin was also higher, which increased from 0.3% to 16.4%, up 16.1% from 1Q15.
	Among the three companies’ financial reports of 2Q15, Trina’s gross margin of 20%, higher than both Canadian Solar’s and JA Solar’s, caught the most attention because it’s a significant improvement from 18% in 1Q15 and 15.4% same period last year. Trina mentioned in the financial report that the key to the rising gross margin is higher module efficiency. In other words, the higher the module efficiency, the lower the production and labor cost per unit and since costs drop faster than retailer prices, gross margin becomes higher.
	260W module is the most common module that’s shipped out by top-tier Chinese manufacturers recently, representing more than 50% of the total shipment. Meanwhile, 260W module is also mainly adopted by new power plants. Top-tier module manufacturers can see their capacities of such products fully booked for at least the next three months, which shows that high-efficiency module is getting popular. On the other hand, because governments will put more emphases on the commercial and residential markets rather than power plants, using high-efficiency modules can lower system cost, increase power generation per unit area, boost ROI, and allow manufacturers to maintain a certain level of gross margin. Therefore, those that take the lead in terms of efficiency will be more likely to be the leading brands in the future.

Solar PV products’ spot prices remained stable despite the current RMB currency devaluation and globally financial tumbles during the past week. Instead, strong demand for PV products sustained the spot prices so that PV manufacturers are planning to raise the prices in September, found EnergyTrend.
In China, polysilicon’s spot prices remained between RMB115/kg and RMB118/kg. EnergyTrend expects that the demand in September will be stronger than in August and the China-made polysilicon’s quotes would be raised.
China-made muiti-si wafers’ quotes ranged from RMB5.8/pc to RMB6/pc, which were lower than Taiwan-made multi-si wafers’ US$0.82~0.825/pc prices. The gap was caused by the depreciated RMB currency exchange rates to US dollar during the past week. As a result, PV cell makers have more options when they choose multi-si wafer suppliers. This also limits wafers’ price raise in the early September.
In contrast with multi-si wafers, demands to mono-si wafers were not strong enough to consume the massive production capacity. Many mono-si wafers were consumed by producing PV cells through OEM cooperation. Adding the depreciation of RMB currency, it is projected another wave of price decrease in September.
Taiwanese PV cells have higher conversion efficiency for the makers to continue raising the spot prices in September regardless of the devaluation of RMB currency. EenergyTrend expects an US$0.32/W average price for Taiwan-made PV cells with efficiency higher than 17.8% in September. Meanwhile, China-made high efficiency PV cells’ spot prices were RMB2.19~2.23/W, and are also expected to slightly rise in next month.
Among the economic recession, orders to China-made PV modules remained strong and are expected to expand until the end of 2015. Furthermore, China may exceed its 17.8GW solar capacity target, the prices is likely to remain despite the recession and currency devaluation in the short-term. Nonetheless, it is uncertain if China’s solar installation target in 2016 would be impacted by the economic conditions.

In fact, Korea has exported more than 4,000 tons of polysilicon to China every month; Wacker is still very important to the Chinese market because it has signed a power purchase agreement with China long time ago; and China has imposed a higher tariff rate on REC, hence the company will completely lose its competitiveness in China.








However, reduction in overseas polysilicon supply did not result in much higher Chinese polysilicon prices. It’s because China’s polysilicon production each reached 14,000 tons in July and August, respectively. In addition to that, there is 9,000 tons of polysilicon import per month, which means there is a total of 23,000 tons every month. To calculate using 5g polysilicon per watt, the existing polysilicon supplies can produce wafer capacity up to 4.5W each month.
According to EnergyTrend’s silver-member monthly report, polysilicon prices will remain at RMB115-118/kg in September. Starting from October, demand for utility-scale projects will continue to increase in China and demand will be stronger in the US and Japan. Under the circumstances where polysilicon imports will reduce further, polysilicon prices may start to rebound in the end of September and beginning of October. However, price increase is limited due to the following factors – Chinese manufacturers’ large amount of supplies and the continuous imports from OCI and Wacker. It’s expected that prices will keep rising until it reaches RMB125/kg.
Thanks to higher cell prices in China, Taiwan, and the third countries, multi-si wafer prices have slowly increased in China. But wafer prices in Taiwan will remain stable at US$0.82-0.825/pc in September since tier-two Chinese manufacturers have lowered the selling prices.
Downstream clients usually request for higher efficiency products, thus cell prices have increased the most within the entire PV supply chain. The price quote for cells with efficiency above 17.8% stayed flat at US$0.32/watt in Taiwan, while it’s between RMB 2.25-2.3/watt for top-tier Chinese manufacturers. Yet, PERC cell prices remained weak as end-user demand has not yet emerged.
Because of growing demand for Chinese power plants, module prices have increased slightly. In fact, the purchase price for individual power plant has exceeded RMB 4/watt recently.

Reduction in overseas polysilicon supply did not result in much higher Chinese polysilicon prices. Prices in September remained at RMB 115-118/kg. After the US and Europe lost access to the Chinese market, Taiwan has become another important market to them. In addition, polysilicon oversupply remains serious in Taiwan as many Taiwan manufacutrers entered into long-term contracts, leading to weak prices.
Thanks to higher cell prices in China, Taiwan, and the third countries, multi-si wafer prices have gradually increased in China and will continue to reflect an uptrend in October. But wafer prices in Taiwan will remain stable at US$0.82-0.825/pc in September because tier-two Chinese manufacturers have lowered the selling prices. Meanwhile, P-type mono-si wafer demand is stable, thus prices may be difficult to pick up. Currently, prices in Taiwan reached US$0.93/pc and may decline further.
Cell prices have increased the most within the entire PV supply chain. The price quote for cells with efficiency above 17.8% stayed flat at US$0.32/watt in Taiwan, while it’s between RMB 2.25-2.3/watt for top-tier Chinese manufacturers. High order visibility allowed tier-two and three to maintain high utilization rates as well. On the other hand, although mono-si demand has slowly increased, mono-si wafer prices remained weak, repressing mono-si cell price rise.
Module prices have increased slightly because of the rising demand for Chinese power plants. Recently, the purchase price for individual power plant has exceeded RMB 4/watt.

                                TrendForce Reports Slow but Steady Price Increases across PV Sector in Next Two Months                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20150917-9446.html,"

The latest photovoltaic (PV) market price report by EnergyTrend, says strong demand from major markets such as China, the U.S., Japan and India ensures that first-tier PV module manufacturers will have fully booked capacities to the end of 2015. In particular, the installation growth rate of PV systems in China continues to rise and may exceed this year’s expectations. This prospect in turn is driving up prices of multi-Si wafers, cells and modules.
According to EnergyTrend analyst Corrine Lin, European and U.S. polysilicon exporters have rerouted their products to Taiwan and South Korea since the end of August, when China suspended the tariff exemption rule for process trade. With the vast Chinese market behind a high tariff barrier, global polysilicon prices are slumping due to oversupply, dropping to a low of US$13.5~14/kg on average. However, this does not mean that the Chinese market is currently witnessing a price increase due to the decrease of imports, and the average price there remains around RMB 114~118/kg. Further reduction of imports may start to have an effect on the Chinese market between late September and early October, and prices will have a chance to bounce back. Nonetheless, this price recovery would be limited because domestic polysilicon producers are expanding their capacities on a massive scale. Moreover, the closing of process trade loophole will not have a significant impact on imports from the leading global suppliers, South Korea’s OCI and Germany’s Wacker. Based on EnergyTrend’s projection, the price threshold in the Chinese polysilicon market will be close to RMB 125/kg. 

As for Si wafers, rising cell prices in China, Taiwan and markets outside these two countries have resulted in a gradual price recovery of Chinese multi-Si wafers. Prices of Taiwanese multi-Si wafers, however, will stay relatively flat around US$ 0.82~0.825/pc in September because they are challenged by lower-priced products from second-tier Chinese suppliers. Looking ahead in October, prices of multi-Si wafers will rise steadily in China. Prices of Taiwanese multi-Si wafers will also go up during the same month, but such increases will be marginal as Chinese suppliers will offer competitive prices due to favorable exchange rates.
PV cells are the main beneficiaries of the price hikes along the supply chain because of the growing end-market demand for high-efficiency products. Many Taiwanese cell manufacturers have been able to keep their prices at US$0.32/W on average owing to their products’ efficiency rates, which can reach upwards of 17.8%. Taiwanese cells are expected to rise to the US$0.325/W level, while the Chinese cells will be approaching to the range of RMB2.25~2.3/W. China and the U.S. are rushing to complete their PV power plants before the conclusion of 2015, and whether price increases in the cell market will start to level off at the end of this year remains to be seen. As for products based on the emerging passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) technology, cell manufacturers will need additional time to make sure their respective PERC processes are stable enough for mass production. Additionally, the overall volume of PERC product trades has fallen short of expectations due to lackluster demand.
In the module market, rising demand of PV power plants in China have helped prices to increase slightly. Some recent orders have passed the RMB 4/W threshold, and prices will keep rising steadily on a weekly basis. Second-tier module suppliers are also seeing their orders returning to the range of RMB 3.8~3.95/W since their capacities are as fully booked as first-tier suppliers. The current market will significantly contribute to module manufacturers’ cash flows, so the outlook in the near future remains positive.

The oversupply of polysilicon will continue in near future, and the price trend remains stable during this week, found EnergyTrend. The polysilicon spot prices fluctuated between RMB113/kg and RMB118/kg in the Chinese market, and the price trends in Taiwanese and Korean markets were also flat.
This week, REC Silicon announced that it may suspend its FBR-processing polysilicon production capacity in Washington, USA. Yet the decision will be finally made on the basis of negotiations between China and the U.S. for the solar trade disputes over polysilicon imports as well as the anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed on Chinese solar panels.
China, Taiwan and third-party countries’ demands to wafers is strong enough to drive the upward trend of wafers’ quotations. However, the payment terms are what determine the actual spot prices. In the recent, some delivery was conducted when fully paid, which is expected to raise the quotations in near future. Taiwan-made wafers’ quotations in October would be between US$0.82/pc and US$0.825/pc as they are challenged by wafers with lower prices made by second-tier wafer manufacturers. Likewise, P-type mono-si wafers’ quotations in next month could decrease as manufacturers will clear as many stocks as possible because most orders were already secured.
PV cells’ spot prices went up during this week. Some Taiwan first-tier manufacturers revealed spot prices up to US$0.325/watt for cells with 17.9% conversion efficiency. China first-tier makers are also moving toward the price of RMB2.3/watt because of higher order visibility. Orders to mono-si PV cells were also increased so second- and third-tier manufacturers’ OEM capacities were mostly full. However, mono-si PV cells’ price increment is restricted to the weak price trend of mono-si wafers.
In terms of quotations PV modules, intense installations in China consume most production capacities of first-tier manufacturers. Strong demand raised the spot prices slightly, while the highest payment range was from RMB3.9/watt to RMB4/watt. The real spot prices were based on the payment terms. EnergyTrend projects a upward trend for PV modules’ quotations in following weeks.

                                China Adds 5.3GW of Solar to its Installation Target in Response to International Emission Reduction Roadmaps                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20151002-9520.html,"

China’s National Energy Administrative (NEA) announced an additional 5.3GW solar installation target on September 28. The additional capacity, including ground-mounted and distributed systems, is required to start constructing in 2015 and to become commercial operating by June 30, 2016. The extra capacity represents China’s ambition to reduce the carbon emissions. It also marks strong demands in the nation over the following years.
According to the announcement unveiled on September 28, the additional capacity is deployed as followed:








Li Keqiang, the Premier of China’s State Council, committed in a document handed to the U.N. that China will make effort to reduce 40~45% of CO2 emissions below 2005 levels by 2020 while increase the portion of non-fossil energy up to 15%. China’s leader Xi Jinping met the U.S.’s president Obama in September, and the two heads together unveiled the “U.S.-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change,” in which China aims to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 60~65% on the 2005 levels by 2030 as well as to prompt nationwide using of non-fossil energy resources up to 20%. All these international claims are correlated to China’s energy policies that were toned to be led by solar power.
Regions with better installing conditions and on-scheduled development like Hebei, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are receiving permission to install more solar capacities. The new Announcement also allocates specific supporting measures region by region. Dany Qian, vice president of JinkoSolar, told a Chinese media, “The new plan is more scientific. They are also reasonable and detailed regarding the geographical allocations and regional needs.” The China’s solar PV industry could be revolutionized by the solar policies including the Pilot Program, while the policies would drive constructions of solar power plants with higher qualities.
In the first half of 2015, China’s total new solar installation capacity was 7.73GW. The 17.8GW annual target could still be completed in time because the fourth quarter is the peak season for solar installations. The same in 2015, the first phase of the 3GW Pilot Program, a total of 1GW solar capacity, has been completely bided and is scheduled to be built in mid-2016. Furthermore, China published this April the “China 2050 High Renewable Energy Penetration Scenario,” depicting a cumulative solar installation capacity of up to 2700GW by 2050 – multiple times higher than the 100~200GW target by 2020 that the Thirteenth Five-year Plan could set. If the nation is to achieve such ambitious goals, it is ineluctable for China to overcome issues including how to fulfill the stronger and stronger demands, how to finance, and how to transfer solar energy as a daily option for citizens.
This Week’s Spot Price
Spot price of China’s polysilicon fluctuated between RMB112~113/kg, representing that most Chinese polysilicon manufacturers were suffering from the dumped polysilicon from overseas makers. Some polysilicon manufacturers even thought it would be difficult to see price rise in the recent future.
Quotes of wafers remained mostly unchanged during this week as China’s National Day Holidays was around the corner. However, Taiwanese market could support price raise in October due to stronger demand even price trend of mono-si wafers was flat.
China’s National Day Holidays restrict price increase of PV cells although the order visibility was still high. While it is noticeable that the quote of mainstream mono-si PV cells went close to RMB2.35/watt, which is almost the same with quotes of multi-si cells. The situation proved that the weak demand to mono-si products would slash their prices, and the multi-si PERC cell manufacturers would be severely impacted if the quotes of China-made mono-si PV cells went closer to or became the same with quotes of multi-si PV cells.
Boomed demand to mutli-si PV modules was triggered by intensive PV system installations in China. The boom also consumed most of first-tier manufacturers’ production capacities as well as drove a slight price increase. The spot prices were settled depending on payment terms. PV modules with profitable payment terms could be sold out by spot price between RMB3.9/watt and RMB4/watt, and the price trend would climb.

                                Orders Flow into PV Sector as Government Initiatives Generate Strong Demand in China                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20151008-9541.html,"

Policy directives from the Chinese government continue to drive the country’s demand for photovoltaic (PV) systems. China’s National Energy Agency has recently increased the national PV installation target and expects an additional 5.3GW-worth of generation capacity to be in operation by the middle of next year. Moreover, demonstration PV projects related to the first phase of the country’s “Top Runner” program are set to operate at the same time as well. Thus, the PV sector will see a surge of orders from China right after the end of this year. Orders from the U.S. will also remain steady through this year even though the market there might start to cool off a bit in December. In sum, quote prices across the PV supply chain will continue to rise at a moderate pace, according to EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce.
“A steady stream of orders will keep the overall production capacity fully booked until the start of the next Chinese New Year holidays in February,” said Corrine Lin, EnergyTrend analyst. “Afterwards, the Chinese demand will continue to keep the sector busy. The U.S. market will also pick up earlier than normal due to stock up activities in preparation for the year-round demand of that region. Therefore, the second quarter of 2016 will be very different from the same period of this year because the PV sector will not be negatively affected by seasonality.”
EnergyTrend’s latest price report shows that in the PV supply chain, polysilicon suppliers are facing weaker prices. The trading prices in the Chinese market are currently between RMB 112~113/kg. While suppliers have been receiving large volumes of orders from the downstream clients, oversupply has become a serious problem and it might suppress potential price increases. Hence, EnergyTrend expects polysilicon prices to remain relatively low through October.
As for Si wafers, the Chinese market has been calm during the National Day holidays in early October. Taiwanese wafer manufacturers however have raised their quotes in response to further increases in cell prices. Prices in the Taiwanese wafer market have generally risen by about US$0.005~US$0.01/pc in October.
Across the supply chain, price increases have been most noticeable in the cell market. Many Taiwanese cell products with conversion efficiency rates of 17.8% and above are now standing at US$0.325/W. Also, products from first-tier Chinese manufacturers are advancing towards RMB 2.35/W. Cell manufacturers are optimistic about the market even though they expect the orders from the U.S. to slow in the beginning of December. Orders from Japan and China will help fill this void. On the other hand, demand of mono-Si cells is still weak and their inventory level continues to rise. The drop in mono-Si cell prices is a notable exception to the general uptrend, with quotes from some Chinese manufacturers matching the prices of high-efficiency multi-Si cells.
“Demand for mono-Si cells will not change much this year despite manufacturers cutting their prices,” said Lin. “However, these products are already very competitive and their impact on the demand of multi-Si PERC cells will become more visible next year.”
The module market is benefitting from the strong demand brought on by the Chinese power plant projects. First-tier module companies are thus seeing strong shipments and expect consistent and moderate price increases after China’s National Day holidays. Presently, 260W modules from some manufacturers have arrived at the RMB 4.05/W threshold, and their prices are likely to keep rising incrementally on a weekly basis. Second-tier module companies have seen their prices returning to RMB 3.85~3.95/W because their capacities are as fully booked as the capacities of first-tier companies. On the whole, EnergyTrend believes module prices will continue to climb in the near future.

Soaring demand from China, Japan and the U.S. ensures that the first-tier photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturers are booked in orders up to the first quarter of 2016. Currently, prices are rising for all multi-Si products from wafers to cells and modules, with wafers having the largest increase due to news of supply shortages. On the other hand, the mono-Si market has not benefited from the sharp rise in demand during this year’s second half. Corrine Lin, analyst for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, said that while the global mono-Si wafer capacity has exceeded 14GW in 2015, this year’s annual demand in the mono-Si end market is projected to be under 10GW. Trades of mono-Si products have remained weak as supply outstrips demand.
Nonetheless, demand of mono-Si products will warm up next year, as they become more accepted in the PV power plant market. Furthermore, PV cell manufacturers have expanded the adoption of the passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) technology and found that PERC produces better efficiency results on mono-Si cells than on multi-Si cells. PERC solutions from different companies are expected to drive the mono-Si market next year when they have become more mature. Though mono-Si products are currently in severe oversupply, their share within the overall product mix will gradually increase starting this year. Furthermore, mono-Si wafer manufacturers have plans to significantly expand their capacities in the next year or two, and the global mono-Si wafer capacity is projected to increase by 20% in 2016.

Price slump continues in the mono-Si wafer market while the multi-Si market benefits from soaring orders
The N-type mono-Si wafer market has been relatively calm compared to the P-type mono-Si wafer market, which has seen greater price competition. Because of a serious supply glut, the average price of mono-Si wafers has kept falling from US$1.04/pc at the start of this year to the current price of US$0.92~0.93/pc. Though the demand-supply situation appears to stabilize for now, price rebound is unlikely and profit margins will stay low. Low mono-Si wafer prices also drive down the costs of mono-Si cells. In China, for instance, some mainstream mono-Si cell products are now at around RMB 2.35/W, matching the prices of multi-Si cells for the first time. This also indicates that module companies are now able to make mono-Si products with high cost-performance ratios.
According to EnergyTrend’s latest price forecast, the multi-Si wafer market has reached a rare state of equilibrium due to a surge of orders from the cell manufacturers. Consequently, multi-Si wafer suppliers have raised their prices in October, starting with leading polysilicon and wafer supplier GCL. Currently, multi-Si wafer prices have reached RMB 6.15/pc in China and are moving towards US$0.84/pc in Taiwan. In the mono-Si cell market, only a few module manufacturers are sending out orders. Mono-Si cell demand is also supplemented by orders outsourced from some larger PV enterprises. EnergyTrend concludes that while mono-Si wafer demand remains weak, but suppliers will likely develop more proactive pricing or business strategies to extend the market shares of mono-Si products.

Strong market demand has been driving the raise of spot prices among the solar supply chain since the start of the third quarter. However, price trend of polysilicon remains weak due to over supply. In China, strike price of polysilicon fluctuates between RMB112~113/kg, while some plumped down to US$13/kg in Taiwan. The trend of polysilicon’s spot prices has been restricted by over supply even the orders from downstream market are intensive. The price trend of polysilicon is projected to remain flat in near future. Meanwhile, international manufacturers such as REC and Hemlock’s transactions in China will be tougher in 2016 because of China’s trade barriers.
Nonetheless, supply shortage went toward wafers and drove the price raise. Tremendous PV installations emerging in China triggered the overwhelming demand to wafers, and wafer manufacturers’ capacities are mostly booked until early 2016. The supply shortage in China led to a upward trend of wafer’s spot price, which has topped RMB6.15/pc reported by leading manufacturers. Likewise, wafer’s price trend in Taiwan was spurred by the price raise of PV cells, and is possible to reach US$0.83~0.84/pc in November. Some Taiwan PV cells manufacturers are booking wafer capacity in November and early December in order to secure the wafer supply.
Price trend of PV cells remains upwards in this week. Some Taiwanese PV cell manufacturers reported US$0.33/W spot price for cells with 17.8% efficiency. Cell supply in China was also short so the spot price RMB2.35/W was reached. Future trend is expected to continue rising.
In terms of price trend of PV modules, demand from Chinese PV power plants is looming, so first-tier manufacturers have been producing by full capacity in the recent. Some vendor are shipping 260W modules under price of RMB4.05/W, and the spot prices are still raising week by week. Spot price of mono-si PV modules are also raised along with the upward trend of multi-si PV modules’ spot prices.

China’s National Reform and Development Commission has announced that there will be no significant reduction in feed-in tariff (FiT) rates for the country’s photovoltaic (PV) power plants in 2016. In its report on improving FiT policies for onshore wind and PV electricity, the commission states that the FiT rates for solar energy resource region one will drop by 5.56% next year. Region one refers to western sections of China (Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and etc.) that are under a more severe electricity rationing regime. For solar resource region two and three, the rate reduction will be less than 5%. Region two includes Beijing, Tianjin and parts of western/central China that are under less severe electricity rationing; whereas region three covers eastern sections of China that have not experienced much electricity rationing as well.
This announcement is not going to dampen the boom in the construction of PV power plants in China while the country’s central government promotes the nation’s 13th Five-Year Plan, according to Corrine Lin, analyst at EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. Conversely, Lin expects that the change in FiT rates will result in a moderate increase in China’s installation demand next year, and prices across the PV supply chain will also continue to rise.
Lin said: “Prices are projected to rise in November and December. However, the market outlook for the end of this year remains uncertain due to the following factors. First, there is the ongoing PV trade dispute between China and the U.S. and the outcome of anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs (AD/CVD) review is still pending. Second, major Chinese PV firms such as Jinko Solar, JA Solar and Trina have expanded their production capacity in foreign countries. How much of an impact their overseas activities will have on the market is yet to be determined.”
Lin added that if the U.S. made concessions to China during the trade negotiation and kept AD/CVD rates low, companies that would be first lose out include those already enjoying low rates or are exempted from tariffs. Cell manufacturers that are able to trade at higher prices by producing outside China and Taiwan would be negatively affected as well.

Polysilicon prices may rise as orders stream into different parts of the supply chain
Polysilicon prices in China remain depressed despite the closing of the processing trade loophole. Though tariffs are blocking imports from major U.S. suppliers such as REC Silicon and Hemlock, the country still allows polysilicon from OCI and Wacker. Imports and excess domestic capacity therefore have created an oversupply situation that currently puts pressure on Chinese polysilicon prices. On the other hand, EnergyTrend’s latest price report notes that China’s new FiT rates will help keep demand high in the Chinese polysilicon market though the first quarter of next year. The country’s polysilicon prices may even bump up a bit in relation to the increases in multi-Si wafer, cell and module prices.
Multi-Si wafers and cells are now in tight supply and their prices have risen accordingly. Moreover, wafer and cell companies are also negotiating for more favorable payment terms as most Chinese firms are fully booked until the next Chinese New Year holidays. Taiwanese firms are starting to negotiate prices for December as well. The multi-Si wafer and cell markets have generally been very hot.
In the module market, some products are seeing incremental price increase. Next year’s FiT rates announcement have led to a build-up of demand in China as module buyers are rushing to stock up before prices go up again. Module manufacturers have been so busy lately that some are unable to accept new orders. EnergyTrend expects that price increases will become more noticeable in the near future and this uptrend will last to the end of this year.

Spot prices of polysilicon are plump although demands from downstream sectors are strong. Oversupply strictly restricts polysilicon price from raising so that inventory is difficult for manufacturers to clean. The price trend is expected to remain weak in near future.
In contrast, multi-si wafers are seeing short supply due to the strong market demand and the quotes have been rising. First-tier Chinese multi-si wafer manufacturers reported quotes up to RMB6.15/pc. In order to secure the wafer source and shipment do downstream sector, most PV cell manufacturers have already booked needed wafers for the entire November. Upon this situation, EnergyTrend expects a continuously upward trend of multi-si wafer’s prices. However, prices of mono-si wafers dropped again due to weak demand.
Price raise of PV cell sector continued during the week. Some Taiwan-made cells with efficiency up to 17.8% have reached US$0.335/W and some were selling cells with higher prices. Prices of PV cells manufactured in third-party countries kept rising to US$0.37~0.38/W, and the slightly upward trend seems to remain. In China, stronger and stronger demand to PV modules with 265W power output drove a new efficiency war among domestic PV cell production. As a result, PV cell supply in China was short in both standard and high-efficiency segment. Some makers shipped their cells by price of RMB2.4/W, and expected an even higher quote for following weeks.
Installation boom in China triggers enormous demand to PV modules so first-tier manufactures are producing under full capacity. Price for 260W modules reached RMB4.05/W and is likely to keep rising. Furthermore, it is found that price of mono-si modules increased together with the price growth of multi-si modules.

The downward price trend of polysilicon in China was halted during the past week because of slight supply shortage of wafers. However, polysilicon outside of China remained oversupply so the spot prices were hard to retain at the same level as they were in prior weeks.
Polysilicon is the only sector in PV value chain that faces price stress. The supply of multi-si wafer was slightly shorter than demand so drove an upward trend of spot prices. EnergyTrend expects a price increase by around US$0.01~0.015/pc in December. In contrast, however, prices of mono-si wafers were still weak. Recent prices in Taiwan have reported to drop down to prices lower than US$0.92/pc.
PV cells enjoyed price raise in the week. Some Taiwan-made PV cells with 17.8% conversion efficiency were sold by US$0.335/W, and the spot price could further climb to US$0.34/W, of which is expected to rise in near future. Nonetheless, the upward trend could stop after the Chinese New Year’s Holiday in 2016 because many manufacturers expects weaken demands after the holiday.
Besides, Chinese clients are turning to buy PV cells with higher efficiency for increasing PV modules’ power output. To manufacture 265W PV modules, demand for high-efficiency PV cells is expected to remain strong.
Demand to PV modules remained strong thanks to China’s domestic solar installation boom. First-tier manufacturers have been producing under full capacity and orders were still highly visible. In the recent, some 260W modules were transacted by price up to RMB 4.05/W, and the quotes seem to climb week by week in the future. Yet some PV systems are still waiting for the Chinese government’s subsidies – if PV system owners were unable to obtain subsidies in time, it would impact operation of PV system developers and EPC service providers in 2016. The delayed subsidies will negatively influence China’s promotion to domestic market.

Selling prices of Polysilicon in Chinese market dropped again in the past year. As EnergyTrend learned, the spot prices decreased because large amount of polysilicon were sold by prices under an agreed range despite Wacker was limited by the agreement. Lower-than-deal prices put stress on polysilicon transactions and resulted in the price downturn.
In contrast to polysilicon, supply of multi-si wafers was slightly shorter than demand, resulting in price raise in recent weeks. Quotes of multi-si wafers in December are expected to rise by more than US$0.01/pc from November. In China, the supply shortage is even severer. Wafer manufacturers have been operating under full capacities for weeks so that provisional, small-quantity orders would only be received under prices higher than average. However, spot price of mono-si wafers kept dropping due to weak demand.
PV cells’ prices went upward following prior weeks and such trend is expected to remain until early January 2016. Many Taiwan-made PV cells with 17.8% efficiency or higher were sold by US$0.34/W, and some cell orders were dealt by prices even higher. Nonetheless, many manufacturers foresee a price drop after the Chines New Year Holiday next year because of expected weaker demand.
Chinese market has been looking for PV modules with higher power output. Such demand represented stable, or stronger, demand to high efficient multi-si PV cells that are for 265W+ modules. It also triggers efficiency competition among the PV cell manufacturers.
PV module demand in China was still strong among the local installation boom. First-tier module manufacturers are producing under full capacities for fulfilling the module orders. In the recent, some 260W modules hit price of RMB4.05/W, and the price is about to increase week by week. However, some PV systems have yet received the governmental subsidies – which will negatively impact operations of system developers and EPC service providers starting from 2016. For developers that are backed by National or Central companies, it is possible for them to run their business through financial methods and debts. For small-scale, private developers, it is highly risky for them to maintain their business under cash flow stress if the subsidies were not paid. In such scenario, some small-scale developers could choose to retreat from the Chinese market in 2016.

EnergyTrend finds a consecutive fall in price trend of polysilicon. Recently, some polysilicon in Taiwan market was sold by price lower than US$13/kg, and the downturn is expected to last for a while.
The multi-si wafer sector was still in short supply in both China and Taiwan markets during the week. As the wafer production volume was unable to meet the demand, the spot prices climbed rapidly like prior weeks. Most multi-si wafer deals for December have been signed, and the very rare spot in stock will only be sold at even higher prices. In contrast, demand to mono-si wafers remained weak in the past week, and the spot price decreased down to below US$0.9/PC in Taiwan.
The PV cell sector was highly demanded so quotes climbed. Some quotes for Taiwan-made PV cells with efficiency of, and higher than, 17.8% topped US$0.34/pc in the past days, and the upward trend is expected to last to late January 2016. The PV cell vendors were generally positive about the future demand until the next Chinese New Year Holiday, according to EnergyTrend’s interviews with them. Nonetheless, there were also manufacturers that are relatively conservative toward cell demand and price trend after the Holiday.
China’s strong demand for purchasing PV modules to construct domestic PV power plants kept module manufacturers running at their full capacities. Spot prices for 260W PV modules remained between RMB3.95~4.05/W during the past week. However, some PV systems have yet received the governmental subsidies – which will negatively impact operations of system developers and EPC service providers starting from 2016. For developers that are backed by National or Central companies, it is possible for them to run their business through financial methods and debts.

Recent polysilicon prices continue to fall. Taiwan can even see prices at US$ 12.5/kg. Affected by an import price of RMB 106/kg, polysilicon prices will still reflect a downtrend in China.
Multi-Si wafer shortage remains in China and Taiwan. Procurement staff had to purchase enough wafers to fulfill a large quantity of cell orders in January. Cell manufacturers try to confirm January wafer demand although multi-Si wafer makers haven’t come up with a price quote for January yet. Due to weaker demand, mono-Si wafer suffers from significant price decline, with the trading prices almost reaching US$ 0.88-0.89/pc in Taiwan. It’s expected that the price gap between mono and multi-Si wafers will be US$ 0.02 only in January.
Overseas module prices have started to drop, leading to limited price increase for cells. Whether cell price can increase in January will have to depend on how much multi-Si wafer prices increase. Despite slow price increase, recent demand from the US and India will result in full order status in the beginning of 2016 in Taiwan.
Module manufacturers will be running at full capacity thanks to strong power plant demand in China before the Lunar New Year. Barely any stocks have left for this year. Although some manufacturers try to increase prices during this time when demand is strong, module prices are likely to stay flat.

Spot price of polysilicon continues dropping. Some polysilicon in Taiwanese market was sold by prices less than US$12.5/kg, while the price trend in China was also weak. As it goes closer to the end of the year, polysilicon manufacturers became more flexible for the prices but more strict with payment terms.
Multi-si wafers remained in short supply in both China and Taiwan. PV cell manufacturers have been purchasing multi-si wafers for cells at climbing prices resulted from strong demand from the downstream sector. The wafer orders in next January were mostly dealt at historical-high prices, found EnergyTrend. In Taiwan, orders of super high efficiency multi-si wafers for 2016 January were transacted at prices higher than US$0.9/pc, while some orders of standard multi-si wafers were dealt at US$0.88/pc. The spot prices rose significantly compared to the US$0.85~0.855/pc quotes reported in December.
In the PV cell sector, it is projected to see a demand slowdown in the U.S. because of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) extension announced this week. U.S.’s demand in 2016 will be less than previously expected so that PV manufacturers that deliver relatively high ratio of their products to the U.S., both directly and indirectly, will be influenced. Furthermore, PV cell orders dealt for January can’t reflect the price rise of wafers as cells have been sold at relatively high prices in December. As a result, the revenues of the PV cell sector will be slightly squeezed in weeks to come.
PV module sector was still warm because of strong demand from Chinese PV power plant constructions. First-tier module manufactures have been producing under full utilization rates for several months, and the smooth shipments keep the inventory low. Nonetheless, we found it is difficult for PV module vendors to sell their products by higher prices. Accordingly, the PV module price trend will remain stable in the recent.

Spot prices of polysilicon in both Taiwanese and Chinese markets kept dropping during this week. In Taiwan, the lowest price has fallen to US$10.5~11/kg level, while the price level in China was as low as at RMB104~106/kg. Nonetheless, the months-continued downward trend could be halted because of stronger demand from the wafer segment and rationalized inventory levels.
Strong demand to wafers helped secure most orders for January in Taiwanese and Chinese markets. In Taiwan, orders of super high efficiency multi-si wafers were dealt at price near US$0.93/pc, while standard high efficiency multi-si wafers were mostly sold at a range of US$0.88~0.90/pc. The price raise in China was also visible as EnergyTrend found spot price that was as high as RMB6.6~6.8/pc although the average price was already restricted by long-term contracts signed by first-tier vertically integrated manufacturers. Yet the price raise is not likely to continue in February 2016 because the prices between mono-si and multi-si wafers are almost identical.
The average prices of mono-si wafers had been falling in early December because they were undersold against multi-si wafers. Fortunately, the average price drop has been stopped recently. Mono-si wafers for Taiwanese markets were sold at a price level higher than US$0.89/pc and for Chinese market at around RMB6.5/pc. It is predicted to see a warm-up of orders for mono-si wafers as the market share of M2 size mono-si wafers are increasing due to better C/P ratio.
Global PV cell demand slightly dropped because the U.S. decided to extent the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which lessened the rush for solar installations in 2016. Adding that the PV cell prices have risen rapidly in the past few weeks, PV cell quotes reported by cell manufacturers only rose slightly for orders in January. Taiwan-bound multicrystalline-Si PV cells were mostly transacted between US$0.34 and $0.345/watt, yet the prices were unable to reflect the price raise of multi-si wafers. Meanwhile, orders for mono-si PV cells were more visible near the end of 2015 because the prices between multi-si and mono-si wafers became almost the same.

Demand to PV modules was still strong due to the rapid installations in China. First-tier makers have been producing products at full capacity and the inventory level was reasonable. Multi-si PV modules were traded at approximately US$0.52/watt in China, and the spot price will be relatively stable before the Chinese New Year Holidays in 2016. However, PV module prices in markets outside China were reported lower than previous weeks, impacting the global average price.

Solar PV price trend during the first week of 2016 has a wait-and-see attitude because most orders for January were dealt in last December and quotes for February will not be reported until mid-January. The major variable to future quotes is the industrial accident happened to DOWA Hightech, a Japan-based global supplier of silver powder for conductive pastes. The manufacturing facility has suspended all production lines after the accident hit, it remained unclear if the PV cell producing and delivery for next month would be influenced.
Spot prices of multi-si wafer climbed rapidly last month, and PV cell manufacturers across the Taiwan Strait ultimately accepted the raise. Most high-efficiency multi-si wafers were sold by prices between US$0.88/pc and US$0.90/pc. In China, the price raise was also significant although some vertically-integrated companies can enjoy economical products secured for longer periods. It was reported that the spot price has reached RMB 6.6~6.8/pc in January. Nonetheless, the price raise seems to be restricted in February because it is less likely for the PV cell sector to increase the selling prices. Prices of mono-si wafers, which were almost at the same level to multi-si wafers, also limited the price raise in near future.
In contrast to multi-si wafer’s prices climb, mono-si wafer makers aim to expand their market shares by reducing the price gap between mono-si and multi-si wafers. As the price trend of multi-si wafers will go stable, EnergyTrend believes that the future spot price for mono-si wafers will remain the same or slightly decrease at a level of approximately US$0.89/pc. It is less possible for mono-si wafer makers to raise the price.
As for PV cell sector, the quotes for January increased only by a small scale. For orders for February, EnergyTrend found many manufacturers did not expect any huge price jump. The Chinese New Year Holiday is a traditional off-peak period for Chinese and Taiwanese industries so that the demand will be too flat for spot price to climb. On the other hand, PV module manufacturers will become reluctant to accept even higher PV cell prices during the off-peak period. Overall, the Taiwan-made PV cells were mostly traded by US$0.34~0.345/watt, yet the price level was unable to reflect the price raise of multi-si wafers.
Besides, the manufacturing suspension period of DOWA has not be decided yet so paste and PV cell makers are evaluating necessity to find substitutes for the upper stream raw materials. The future PV cell manufacturing and delivery will be impacted if it took a long period for DOWA to restart operation.
Demand to PV modules was still strong due to installation boom in China, bringing quote increase. However, the real spot prices were at around US$0.52/watt. Such a spot price is expected to remain until the Chines New Year Holiday in early-to-mid February.

                                PV Demand Remains Strong in 1Q16; Prices of Multi-Si Wafers and Cells to Peak in February                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160115-10073.html,"

The general outlook for the 2016 PV market has become more certain as China, the U.S. and the U.K. finalize their respective subsidy policies. “China plans to connect the country’s PV power plants onto the grid before the middle of the year,” said Corrine Lin, analyst for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. “Therefore, major manufacturers of multi-Si wafers, cells and modules will be running at full capacity during the first quarter.”
A major silver powder plant owned by DOWA Hightech had an accident in early January. This event is currently the only variable that could affect the PV supply chain since DOWA Hightech is the leading supplier of silver powder for conductive paste. Cell manufacturers will have difficulty maintaining their high capacity utilization if the silver powder plant does not return to full operation soon.
In the U.S. market, the extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has dampened the industry’s anticipation of an installation rush in the second half of 2016. Lin expects the worldwide boom in PV demand to wind down after the Chinese New Year holidays. Presently, prices across supply chain are almost at their highest and will have difficulty to move up any further.
Decline in polysilicon prices starts to moderate; multi-Si wafers and cells are nearing their peaks
The latest reporting from EnergyTrend reveals oversupply and Chinese trade barriers have caused polysilicon prices to drop sharply this month despite the unusually warm demand. The Chinese polysilicon market remains in a slump with the average dealing price arriving around RMB 104~106/kg. However, most Chinese polysilicon manufacturers and their downstream clients have kept their inventory levels under control to approximately two weeks to a month. While the decline of polysilicon prices will persist, the trend will start to moderate.
The multi-Si wafer market are seeing prices go up rapidly this month on account of demand outstripping supply. On the whole, the capacity increases undertaken by multi-Si wafer manufacturers during 2015 were the most conservative compared with capacity increases in other segments of the PV supply chain. However, TrendForce estimates that there will still be an additional 5GW added to overall multi-Si wafer capacity in 2016. The tight supply situation is therefore expected to get some relief in the near future, and multi-Si wafer prices will peak in February.
The mono-Si wafer market by contrast is experiencing a severe supply glut. According to EnergyTrend, demand for mono-Si products totaled around 9.5GW in 2015, but the entire mono-Si wafer capacity exceeded 15GW for the same year. Moreover, Longi, Zhonghuan and GCL will be expanding their mono-Si capacities over this year. Hence, there will be no relief to the mono-Si oversupply problem in the short term. Mono-Si wafer prices have been kept at US$0.89/pc in the recent period, but later they will fall gradually.
The significant rise in multi-Si wafer prices has not fully reflected in this month’s cell prices, which have only increased slightly. Another factor that is constraining the cell prices is the outlook of the module market at the turn of the year. Installation peak seasons for the U.K., Japan and India have just passed, so module demand and prices in general are expected to weaken. Excluding the possibility of a conductive paste shortage, cell prices will likely peak around the Chinese New Year holidays.
Though first- and second-tier module manufacturers have lately benefitted from the installation rush in China and Japan and reported high capacity utilization, module prices in overseas markets (outside China) have begun their descent. Module orders from major regional markets are also at their highest and are unlikely to rise any further. Module prices are currently maintained in the range of RMB 3.9~4.05/W and will drop a bit after the Chinese New Year holidays.

The recent Chinese PV market is warm enough to drive price increase of polysilicon, a sector in PV value chain that struggled for significant price downturn during the fourth quarter of 2015. PV wafer manufacturers are piling up polysilicon before the Chinese New Year holiday so the price jumped from last week’s RMB 104~106/kg to RMB 108~110/kg. As the Chinese New Year is around the corner, EnergyTrend expects an upward trend in the polysilicon sector. However, the total production capacity is still large enough to meet all demands, meaning that it is unlikely to see supply shortage after the holidays.
In contrast to the heating-up market, polysilicon trade in Taiwan remained flat during this week.
Quotes for multi-si wafers for February orders slightly grew. Multi-si wafers were mostly sold at around US$0.90/pc in Taiwan, while the quotes in China were still high. The most noticeable situation is that many Chinese first-tier manufacturers have increased mono-si products’ volume in their 2016 business strategies because the quotes of mono-si wafers had dropped to a level lower than multi-si wafers. Such a competitive price brought mono-si wafer manufacturers a large amount of orders in China. As a result, we project a better year for mono-si products in the Chinese market.
Price trend of PV cells went correspondent with EnergyTrend’s expectation – the quotes went slightly up for February orders, and some manufacturers reported the same spot price with the prior week. The restricted price trend was resulted from the rapid increase in previous months. The price outlook for post-holiday is not clear at present, but it is observed that the recent order volume was not as high as in prior months. OEM orders for mono-si PV cells, on the other hand, reversely increased during this week.
PV module prices remained at approximately US$0.52/watt thanks to the continuously strong demand for PV power plants in China. EnergyTrend expects a relatively even price trend for multi-si PV modules in the market until the Chinese New Year, while the spot price of PV modules outside China could be sold at a lower level than earlier.

In China, more PV power plants are switching to mono-Si products. This factor and the impending end of the country’s installation rush have caused prices of multi-Si products (e.g. wafers, cells and modules) to level after the Chinese New Year holidays, said Corrine Lin, assistant research manager for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. However, strong demand from mono-Si and multi-Si wafer manufacturers continue to drive the production of polysilicon, which is seeing a sharp rise in prices as the supply tightens in the short run.
Polysilicon prices bounce back after hitting the bottom; the competition between mono-Si and multi-Si wafer products intensify
The latest price report from EnergyTrend finds that polysilicon prices in China quickly went back up in the latter half of January on account of the robust demand from both mono-Si and multi-Si wafer industries. The average dealing price in the Chinese polysilicon market rose from RMB104~106/kg at the start of January to RMB 115/kg after the Chinese New Year holidays. Quoted prices are still climbing as inventories of major manufacturers are nearly depleted.
In the wafer market, some of the demand is now shifting to mono-Si products. This in turn alleviates the supply shortage of multi-Si products and has caused their prices to level following the consistent increases since the fourth quarter of 2015.
Currently, major mono-Si wafer manufacturers such as Longi and Zhonghuan are in the midst of their capacity expansion plans. The supply of mono-Si product therefore has become tight. Lin pointed that this trend is temporary, and the supply of mono-Si wafers for the entire 2016 will still exceed their total demand. EnergyTrend expects a short-term uptick in mono-Si wafer prices that will coincide with a weakening of multi-Si wafer prices in the second quarter. By that time, mono-Si products will again be priced slightly above their multi-Si counterparts.
Outlook for multi-Si products become more conservative while the mono-Si market expected to see rising price and demand
Currently, cell and module manufacturers are continuing to fulfill orders that they received before the Chinese New Year holidays. They are still uncertain about the amount of new orders that will be coming in. Demand from China will be the only major support for prices in the downstream market during the second quarter. While EnergyTrend expects manufacturers of mainstream multi-Si cells and modules to continue to operate at full capacity, seasonal factors will soon start to negatively affect prices outside China.
Demand for mono-Si products from PV plants in China is anticipated to expand from 15% in 2015 to 25% this year. This Chinese demand, along with the smaller number of mono-Si wafer and cell suppliers in the market, means that prices of mono-Si products will remain strong and even increase slightly in the short term.

The Chinese market held more conservative attitude after the Lunar New Year. Despite top-tier manufacturers’ full-production status, second-tier Chinese cell manufacturers could start to feel some sales pressure. The polysilicon market saw weaker prices at RMB 2.35/W after the Lunar New Year.
Taiwanese manufacturers are still running at full capacity to satisfy Chinese mono-Si wafer makers’ OEM orders. Although mono-Si cell was originally priced at US$ 0.34-0.343/W, some orders have been cancelled as the price increase in the previous months have led to lower profit margins for vertically-integrated manufacturers. Since Taiwanese makers placed most of their orders on Chinese vertically-integrated manufacturers, if orders do get cancelled, the capacity vacated will not allow a negotiation on the prices. Cells from outside of China and Taiwan will still be at a price level of above US$ 0.39/W owing to zero-tariff advantages.
Due to the end of peak-selling season, cell manufacturers can begin to see lower prices and plan to negotiate the prices with polysilicon manufacturers. Back in February, high-efficiency multi-Si wafer was generally traded at the price of US$ 0.90/pc in Taiwan, while Chinese multi-Si wafer prices remained high. However, lower cell prices in March may result in weaker multi-Si wafer prices as well.
Looking ahead to the future, manufacturers will still witness 100% utilization rates following the final installation boom in China from March to April. But as the installation boom from 4Q15 will come to an end at May-end and no demand will be seen in the US, Japan, India, and the UK yet, 3Q16 will become the season with the lowest demand this year. Moreover, because Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers will roll out new cell and module capacities in the end of 2Q, we can foresee serious oversupply issues in 3Q16. By then, prices will drop rapidly, which will be another crisis for manufacturers with unstable export markets.

                                China’s xEV Policies to Influence Supply-Demand Situation of Cylindrical Lithium Cells for IT Applications                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160311-10281.html,"

China’s flourishing x-electric vehicle (xEV) market kept domestic and foreign lithium battery manufacturers from Japan and South Korea running at full capacity in 2015, according to EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. The xEV boom has encouraged manufacturers not only to accelerate their capacity expansion efforts in China but also reallocate their capacities to boost xEV battery production. Consequently, there was a supply shortage of cylindrical cells used in information technology (IT) applications during the second half of last year. On the other hand, the Chinese government has begun phasing out price subsidy for xEV purchase since this January, leading to a more cautious market sentiment. Hence, xEV battery demand is expected to weaken and its pressure on the IT cell capacity will start to ease.
“Prices of IT cylindrical cells stopped falling in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to tight supply and may start to bounce back in the first quarter of this year,” said Duff Lu, research manager for EnergyTrend. “Whether the IT cell market will be tipped in favor of the sellers will depend on China’s xEV policies.”
The lithium polymer cell market has witnessed fierce competition recently. Chinese second-tier battery makers attempted to expand their polymer cell market shares with aggressive pricing in final quarter of 2015. Moreover, there will be new entrants to this market in the first quarter of this year, and their additional capacity may drive down prices further.
As for the prismatic cell market, prices will remain fairly constant in this year’s first quarter, fluctuating within the usual range of 2~3% compared with the prior quarter. The steady price trend is attributed to the lack of significant changes in the overall polymer cell capacity and the lack of growth in the product’s penetration rate.








China’s xEV battery industry is due for a shakeout as the market demands products that meet safety standards
The Chinese government originally plans to gradually reduce the subsidy rate for xEV purchase over the 2016~2020 period, and the program will officially end after 2020. However, many local government agencies have already made large cuts to the subsidy rate or suspended the program all together, causing panics in the xEV industry.
With regard to the lithium battery industry, the Chinese government continues to promote the localization of component manufacturing and use energy density as the main benchmark for industry development. As the xEV subsidy rate decreases every year, battery manufacturers have to improve the efficiency of their products to reduce costs. Currently, a Chinese-made lithium cell can reach an energy density of at least 180 watt-hours per kilogram, and its cost can be kept at RMB 2 per watt-hour or under. Though the Chinese lithium battery industry met the energy density target set by the government ahead of schedule, this achievement came at the expense of the product safety and battery life. The quality problems with Chinese cells have caused numerous safety incidents for plug-in cars and buses in recent years.
“The short-term outlook of the lithium battery market may be worrying as the Chinese government scales back xEV subsidies and implements stricter standards on related product specifications,” said Lu. “Nonetheless, a careful examination of the new policies will reveal that the government is actually helping the xEV and battery industries to make the necessary transitions so that their products would be mature enough to compete with traditional fuel vehicles in the long run. Thus, subsidy program have to be more complete and product standards have to be revised in order to move the xEV industry forward.”

                                PV Cell Prices Are Falling Faster Than Expected Due to Cooling Demand                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160311-10282.html,"

EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, reports that the global PV market is seeing slowing demand after the Chinese New Year holidays. Peak installation seasons in the U.S. and Japan have passed, and the demand related to China’s efforts to connect its PV power plants to the grid is also subsiding as this mission is set to be completed at the end of June. Chinese and Taiwanese cell suppliers will be the first to be impacted by the weakening demand since most of their orders come from vertically integrated manufacturers in China, said Corrine Lin, assistant research manager for EnergyTrend. Prices of Chinese cells have been falling following the Chinese New Year holidays, and Taiwanese cell suppliers have also been slashing their prices to earn more orders.
Taiwanese cell suppliers previously also exported to Europe and Japan in addition first-tier Chinese PV companies. However, this strategy of reducing the risk of relying on one regional market began to break down last year, when Japanese PV companies reduced their orders for Taiwanese cells due to domestic subsidy cuts. To save costs, Japanese clients switched from the pricier Taiwanese cells to the more economical products from vertically integrated Chinese manufacturers. Consequently, Taiwanese cell exports to Japan were roughly halved in 2015. As for the European market, demand there has been in a lengthy slump. Hence, Taiwanese cell industry is again relying on orders from major Chinese clients and their OEM partners in Southeast Asia to consume its enormous capacity.
“Last year’s PV cell shortages were mostly the result of installation rush in China,” said Lin. “A weakening in China’s domestic demand will therefore affect Taiwanese cells first since they are already overpriced.” If major Chinese clients – Trina Solar, Jinko, Canadian Solar, and JA Solar – decided to scale back their cell purchases, Taiwanese cell suppliers will suddenly have a massive excess capacity problem. Under this circumstance, any one cell supplier cutting prices will create a domino effect as other suppliers will follow suit and reduce their prices as well.
Despite intense negotiations between Taiwanese cell suppliers and their downstream clients, the average price of Taiwanese cells has already dropped sharply in the past two weeks, from above US$0.342/W to around US$0.335~0.338/W. There is also increasing price competition from many second- and third-tier Chinese PV manufacturers that try to capture more orders and keep up their capacity utilization rates. The average price of Chinese cell have fallen from RMB 2.45/W before the Chinese New Year to about RMB 2.3/W this month. This downtrend is expected to persist.
Lin added that China’s domestic PV demand for 2016 will be far below the earlier estimate of 20GW due to several factors. First, changes in the subsidy policy will have an impact on China’s market outlook. Secondly, there are limits to the amount of tradable PV electricity going into the country’s power grids, and the overall rate of PV electricity being “abandoned” is rising. Furthermore, newly expanded capacities of numerous manufacturers will cause serious oversupply problem. Both Taiwanese and Chinese cells have already witnessed a price decline of more than US$0.01/W this month. In order to maintain their margins, cell suppliers will have to negotiate down wafer prices. On the whole, PV prices are now coming down from their peaks in March because the weakness in the cell market have led to price declines across the supply chain. If manufacturers have yet to set up production facilities outside China and Taiwan or develop a more flexible business strategy, they may see losses in the second quarter.

                                Spot Price of Taiwan-made PV Cells Drops 2.5% This Week: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160401-10349.html,"

Spot prices of polysilicon in China rose to RMB 120 (US$18.56) to RMB 125 per kilogram due to the slightly tight supply in the market, which caused by higher utilization rates of both mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer capacities. Spot prices in Taiwan also increased, reaching US$16 per kg.
Most manufacturers currently have little polysilicon available for immediate delivery and therefore have begun securing orders for April. As most prices have been settled, polysilicon prices in April are expected to remain stable, although prices of multi-si wafers and PV cells dropped in downstream supply chain.
Trading volume of multi-si wafer was small in the market because the PV cells’ price dropped more significant than multi-si wafers’. The relatively slight price decrease of multi-si wafers was from two factors: the price raise of polysilicon in upper stream and smaller capacity expansion scales than PV cells in downstream in this year. However, the price drop in multi-si wafers is forecast to deteriorate to reflect the large price cut in the PV cells segment.
In terms of mono-si wafers, the hot demand continued to set up for a price hike. The recent prices of mono-si wafers in China were reported at between RMB 6.7 and RMB 6.8/piece, while the prices in Taiwan ranged between US$0.92 and US$0.93/piece. However, Corrine Lin, Assistant Research Manager at EnergyTrend, believed prices of mono-si wafers have peaked this year, particularly at a time when the price upward of multi-si wafers are restricted.
In PV cell markets in China and Taiwan, as orders were limited to a small number of manufacturers, vertically-integrated makers in the downstream slashed prices to lead to the largest price drop in Taiwan in recent years, at between US$0.315 and US$0.318/ W. Some larger manufacturers have lowered their utilization rates to around 8%0. In addition, China’s domestic demand apparently slowed down, forcing makers to re-focus their shipment to overseas. India, where demand remains stable, has become one of the major markets for the PV cell manufacturers. Prices of high-efficiency PV cells in China remained at around RMB 2.4/W, while some second-tier manufacturers continued to lower their prices.
Top-tier PV module manufacturers maintained their prices at between RMB 3.8 and RMB 3.9/W for multi-si modules, while second-tier makers began to lower their prices to between RMB 3.65 and RMB 3.8/W due to the lack of big orders. Nonetheless, as the overall market demand cools down, average prices are expected to slowly decrease.

In the China market, polysilicon has been slightly shortage in supply because newly added mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer capacities cause difficulties to procure spot products. Therefore, mainland China's polysilicon price had reached RMB 125~127/kg, and it continued to move toward RMB 130/kg. Currently, inventories of major polysilicon manufacturers are nearly depleted and April’s orders were mostly finalized, so the market's focus shifted to May's orders. Although prices of downstream multi-si wafers and PV cells have started to drop, polysilicon's recent prices were maintained stably.
In the Taiwan market, polysilicon's price has been risen to US$ 13.5~14.5/kg as the China polysilicon market's average dealing price reached US$16.5/kg (US dollar exchanged from RMB). The upcoming trend of Taiwan's polysilicon prices is expected to keep on growing.
For the c-Si wafer segment, most multi-si wafer manufacturers' quote prices only slightly dipped or even stayed flat. PV cell manufacturers were having a hard time accepting this price trend due to rapid price fall of PV cells, so the market volume was not much. Nonetheless, when multi-si wafer's inventories accumulate and pressures pile up, multi-si wafer's price fall will accelerate. That phenomena will eventually reflect the price plunge of multi-crystalline PV cells.
Mono-si wafer's demand has been strong, so China's mono-si wafer's average price was maintained stably at RMB 6.7~6.8/pc. Taiwan's was ranged from US$0.91~0.93/pc. However, mono-si wafer's price should have reached this year's peak because multi-crystalline market's prices have been sluggish. Next month's price trend might start to become weak.
As for PV cells, in China and Taiwan, both regions’ PV cell manufacturers received orders way too concentrated in the previous quarter. Now this quarter's demand was suddenly frozen, and vertically integrated manufacturers dramatically slashed prices. In Taiwan, the price has astonishingly plummeted since March, and average price reached around US$0.31/W. In this week, price fall scale was again more than 2.5%.
Some of PV cell manufacturers with larger capacities already adjusted downwards their utilization to around 80%. Since China's domestic market demand slowed down quite significantly, PV cell manufacturers rose shipment proportions to other markets. India, with a relatively stable demand, became one of the critical target markets. Nevertheless, low-price markets kept on lowering PV cell manufacturers' average dealing price.
China's tier-one manufacturers hoped high-efficiency PV cell's price will be maintained within the range around RMB 2.4/W, but tier-two manufacturers continued to lower prices in order to maintain their utilization rates. On the whole, the demand was relatively weak and the price gap between China and Taiwan kept on shrinking. Taiwan's manufacturers' overall gross margins have plunged as well.
As for mainstream multi-crystalline modules, tier-one manufacturers' prices were held around RMB 3.8~3.9/W. However, China's large-scale PV power plants' demand has weakened drove tier-two manufacturers to lower prices to RMB 3.6~3.7/W. The price gap between tier-one and tier-two has been widen. Because the whole market demand has been cooling down, prices will remain a slow downtrend.

Last week, China government suddenly started to investigate thoroughly polysilicon material sources that circumvented China's anti-dumping and countervailing duties and smuggled to the Chinese market. This move worsened the availability of spot products for polysilicon in China. As a result, mainland China's polysilicon's price surpassed 130RMB/kg, and the orders of May were still undergoing negotiation.
Therefore, although downstream prices of multi-si wafer and PV cells started to drop, polysilicon’s price trend will maintain a slow growth until early May. The uptrend will be relatively eased during late May. Besides, polysilicon’s average price in the China market reached US$ 16.5~17/kg and triggered average prices in non-China regions such as Taiwan and South Korea to raise to US$13.5~14.5/kg. In the future, it might top US$ 15/kg.
As for si-wafer, most of China's multi-si wafers' quotes were modified downwards to around US$ 0.86/pc. Nonetheless, PV cell manufacturer whose PV cell prices were rapidly falling would like to fight for lower multi-si wafer prices, so the market volume was not much. In late April, multi-si wafers’ price fall will accelerate because of accumulated inventory. That phenomena will eventually reflect the price plunge of multi-crystalline PV cells.
Due to mono c-si wafers' skyrocketing demand, mono c-si wafer's price was maintained stably at around 6.7~6.8RMB/pc in the China market. In the Taiwan market, mono-si wafer's price was maintained at the range of US$0.91~0.93/pc. Nevertheless, sluggish multi-crystalline market will limite mono c-si wafer's price to reach another peak.
In view of PV cells in both China and Taiwan markets, PV cell manufacturers received orders way too concentrated in the previous quarter. Now this quarter's demand was suddenly frozen, and downstream vertically integrated manufacturers dramatically slashed prices. In Taiwan, the price has astonishingly plummeted since March, and average price has dropped from US$0.305/W. This week's price fall scale was not as dramatic as previous weeks', yet the reason was stress of going depict due to gross margin lower than 5%.
Since China's domestic market demand slowed down, manufacturers started to increase non-China markets' shipment proportion. India, with a relatively stable demand, became one of the critical target markets. Nevertheless, PV cell manufacturers' average dealing price has been dragged down by low-price market.
Moreover, mainland China's tier-one manufacturers hoped to maintain high-efficiency PV cell's price within the range from 2.3~2.35 RMB/W, but tier-two manufacturers continued to lower prices in order to maintain their utilization rates. On the whole, because the demand was relatively weak and the price gap between China and Taiwan was very small, the future PV cell price is predicted to continue to weaken.
As for mainstream multi-crystalline modules, downstream PV power plant developers knew that PV cell price dropped rapidly, so they kept on pressing module manufacturers. Hence, module price continued to fall slowly. Tier-one vertically integrated manufacturers could maintain their demand and prices via their own power plants. Tier-two or tier-three manufacturers' prices apparently remained weak.

                                Prices in All Segments of PV Supply Chain Weaken except Polysilicon Market                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160421-10436.html,"

Seasonality and the end of installation rush in China have weakened prices of multi-Si products, from wafers to cells and modules, said Corrine Lin, assistant research manager for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. Polysilicon prices in China, on the other hand, have risen significantly as wafer manufacturers have been operating at full capacity and expanding capacities at the same time. Furthermore, the Chinese government has tighten its regulatory process for polysilicon imports to prevent smuggling, adding more pressure on the country’s supply.
Currently, polysilicon and mono-Si wafers are relatively high, but EnergyTrend expects them to flatten and then fall towards the end of May due to the deceleration in the overall demand. As the industry enters the year’s slowest season, all major segments of the PV supply chain along with the markets for related products and materials will witness falling prices from June onward. Demand will return in the U.S., China, Japan and India after August, and prices will start to recover by then.
Chinese smuggling investigation disrupts polysilicon price trends in different markets
In early April, Chinese authorities suddenly imposed stricter control over polysilicon imports by reviewing foreign sources of the raw material to make sure they are subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The Chinese investigation continues to have an impact on the spot trade of polysilicon in the country, and the average spot price has risen to above RMB 130/kg. The recent price declines in the downstream markets are unlikely to affect polysilicon prices in China as most of the orders for May have been settled. Hence, Chinese polysilicon prices will keep rising to the first of half of May.
There are a lot of uncertainties in polysilicon markets outside China, including Taiwan and South Korea. Spot prices in these markets are supposed to go up following the rising prices in China. However, European and the U.S. polysilicon manufacturers such as Hemlock and REC Silicon are shut out of the Chinese market due to tariffs and the closing of custom loopholes. This situation may force them to dump their products in other countries, creating the possibility of price decline in Taiwan and South Korea. The only major foreign polysilicon manufacturer that is not facing a high tariff rate in the Chinese market is South Korea’s OCI. The supplier will be able to raise its prices according to the local demand.








Margins for cell products are approaching to zero due to falling demand across the supply chain
Compared with other parts of the supply chain, the PV cell market has suffered the steepest price decline since the end of the Chinese New Year holidays. Margins of cell products have been reduced to almost zero during this two month period.
Lin noted that cell makers are now asking for reduction in multi-Si wafer quotes as cell prices are anticipated to soon fall below US$0.3/W. There has been no noticeable weakness in wafer prices until very recently, and wafer suppliers did manage to maintain their prices for a short while by using the high cost of polysilicon as a justification. EnergyTrend expects decline in wafer prices to become visible in May, when poor sales and inventory pressure start to have an effect on the market.
With regard to prices of PV modules, they will continue to fall due to the developments in the cell market. Power plant companies will cite sharp decline in cell prices when they bargain down module prices.

	Aside from polysilicon that sees stronger prices, prices in all segment of PV supply chain have weakened. The industry will cool down after June 30th, where grid-connection will mostly be completed by then. Demand is expected to decrease, resulting in lower overall prices in July and August.

	 

Polysilicon Smuggling Investigation Emerges, Boosting Polysilicon Prices

	 

	In early-April, the Chinese government suddenly started to investigate thoroughly polysilicon material sources that circumvented China's anti-dumping and countervailing duties and smuggled to the Chinese market. This move worsened the availability of spot products for polysilicon in China. As a result, mainland China's polysilicon's price surpassed 145RMB/kg and the orders of June were undergoing negotiation. 
	 

	Therefore, although downstream prices of multi-si wafer and PV cells started to drop, polysilicon’s price trend will maintain a slow growth until May and may even exceed RMB 150/kg. Polysilicon material sources also reduced significantly in non-Chinese regions as OCI, a manufacturers that is little affected by the anti-dumping and countervailing duties, continuously ships polysilicon to China, leading to higher prices. 
	 

	But EnergyTrend believes that the rising polysilicon prices will cause second-tier ingot makers to lower the production. If manufacturers keep on reducing the production, it will not be good to polysilicon sales. Hence, price growth should slow down after it reaches RMB 150/kg, so wafer manufacturers could have some time to rest. 
	 

Up and Downstream Prices Continue to be in a See-saw Relationship 

	 

	Chinese and Taiwanese wafer manufacturers have completed negotiating for wafer prices in May, yet GCL’s prices only slightly declined, and thus the decline in wafer prices was not in cell maker’s expectation. Chinese multi-Si wafer was priced at RMB 6.2-6.3/pc, while Taiwanese multi-Si wafer reached US$ 0.85-0.86/pc. Because cell makers could barely make any profits with this price, wafer prices will reflect a downtrend as cell prices weakens.
	 

	Some cell orders was closed at a price below US$ 0.3/W, but some cell makers still weren’t willing to give in. Therefore, they started to stabilize the price through asking if their buyers are willing to increase high-efficiency cell production to slow down the decline in prices. 
	 

	Due to strong demand from downstream sectors, many module makers have placed orders with mono-Si wafer and cell makers, leading to stable prices. Mono-Si prices can stay flat until multi-Si wafer and cell prices drop significantly again. 
	 

	Module prices were requested to be lowered by power plant manufacturers as cell prices declined too fast. Module prices will continue to reflect a downtrend because manufacturers will begin to negotiate 2H16 orders after June 30th and there will be no need to rush connecting to the grid.

Manufacturers have finished negotiating for May orders, leading to smaller fluctuation in prices. Due to the interruption of trade wars, the polysilicon market still witness slight supply shortage, resulting in stronger prices. But prices increased in a slower-pace limited by downstream prices. As for mid and downstream makers, prices have gradually declined.
Owing to the interruption of trade wars, polysilicon prices have increased significantly in China, reaching RMB 143-146/kg. Because prices have surpassed the limit which Wacker previously negotiated with China, Wacker’s imports are no longer affected by the trade barriers. Therefore, Wacker and OCI, with the lowest anti-dumping and countervailing duty rate, are the biggest polysilicon importers in China.
After Wacker rolls out new capacities and REC resumes production, polysilicon shortage may be relieved slightly. In addition to that, demand will begin to drop, and thus it may be difficult for polysilicon prices to remain high in the end of June, if there are no other interruptions.
Mid and Downstream Sectors Experience Slow Price Downtrend Pre-SNEC
	Orders have been confirmed for wafer, cell, and module makers in May. Multi-Si wafer was priced at RMB 6.2-6.3/pc, with some orders dropping to RMB 6.15/pc. Prices were mostly within the range of US$ 0.85-0.86/pc in Taiwan.
	Chinese cell prices have slightly declined, while some trading prices fell below US$ 0.3/W in Taiwan. But the decline in prices has slowed down this week. The next price fluctuation will depend on the competition between mid and downstream manufacturers during China’s biggest PV exhibition – SNEC.
	Due to strong demand from downstream sectors, many module makers have placed orders with mono-Si wafer and cell makers, leading to stable prices. Mono-Si prices can stay flat until multi-Si wafer and cell prices drop significantly again.

	Ever since the Lunar New Year, polysilicon prices have increased rapidly to RMB 145-150/kg recently. As market uncertainties have mostly been eliminated, prices have turned stable. Weaker demand from downstream sectors may lead to slower price growth and prices will peak in late-May. After June, prices will gradually decrease following lower demand.

	 

	Wafer, cell, and module makers have completed negotiating for May orders. Chinese multi-Si wafer is priced at RMB 6.2-6.3/pc, with some orders reaching RMB 6.15/pc. Meanwhile, Taiwanese multi-Si wafer is priced at US$ 0.85-0.86/pc. Because multi-Si wafer prices didn’t really reflect the decline in downstream prices, prices may drop further during China’s biggest PV exhibition – SNEC.

	 

	Cell makers witness slight decline in prices. Some cells are even priced below US$ 0.3/W in Taiwan. However, the decline in cell prices has slowed down this week. The next price fluctuation will depend on the competition between mid and downstream manufacturers during SNEC. What’s worth notice is that due to strong demand from downstream sectors, many module makers have placed more orders with mono-Si wafer and cell makers, resulting in strong mono-Si demand.

	 

	Module manufacturers have started to negotiate for 2H16 orders before the demand growth slows down by June 30th. Module prices will continue to reflect a downtrend as China will witness the lowest demand in 3Q16 and power plant makers are expecting weaker module prices.

The sales of x-electric vehicles (xEV) in China reached a historic high of 300,000 units in 2015. Correspondingly, the market for xEV lithium batteries witnessed surging growth in the same period. In the fourth quarter, for instance, xEV batteries for vehicles models such as passenger cars and microcars took off. Strong demand in the xEV market has put pressure on the supply of cylindrical lithium cells for IT applications (e.g. notebook and tablet batteries). Affected by supply shortages, the prices of cylindrical cells have also recovered from their long slump. According to EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, prices of cylindrical cells of all capacity types (i.e. high, low and medium) in this year’s first quarter was on average 1~3% higher than in the previous quarter due to the competing demand from xEV and IT markets. EnergyTrend furthermore expects steady growth in both demand and supply of cylindrical cells in the near future.








Just as the demand of cylindrical cells has been outpacing their supply, polymer cells are gaining considerable grounds in the IT battery market this year and are starting to take over cylindrical cells’ place in related applications. EnergyTrend Research Manager Duff Lu pointed out that branded notebook vendors are adding new notebook products powered by polymer cells in proportion to their reduction of upcoming models that use cylindrical cells. The increase in the adoption of polymer cells by notebook vendors fits into the long-term trend of consumer electronics becoming lighter and more mobile. To take advantage of this opportunity, China-based polymer cell manufacturers have been rapidly expanding their capacities and even lowering prices of their products to capture market shares from prismatic cells in different applications.
In the prismatic market, Samsung SDI and LG Chem have long been the dominant suppliers, and together they control over 80% of the global market. The two South Korean battery makers initially planned to use prismatic cells to replace cylindrical cells in some application markets. With prices of polymer cells in decline, however, they are holding off on carrying out this particular product strategy this year. Falling polymer cell prices also affected the enthusiasm of notebook vendors for adopting prismatic cells. As a result, there was a noticeable oversupply of prismatic cells in the notebook battery market during the first quarter of 2016.

Members of the PV industry will be gathering in Shanghai next week for China’s largest solar energy trade show, SNEC 2016. The tradeshow will provide a venue for manufacturers across the PV supply chain to negotiate their orders in June. Therefore, the global PV market will not witness noticeable price fluctuations this month.
“In the first quarter, major regional markets such as China, the U.S., Japan and India experienced a surge in demand,” said Corrine Lin, assistant research manager for EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. “Since the second quarter, however, most PV power plant operators have assumed that PV module prices will be in a steady decline. Thus, demand has slowed down in most markets. India is an exception as the country is busily connecting PV plants to grid before the deadline. In sum, the market is entering off-peak season.”

Prices across PV chain drop as downstream demand starts to cool
Polysilicon prices in China have been rising significantly since the Chinese New Year holidays, reaching RMB 145~150 per kilogram in the recent period. The rising prices have also continued to put the squeeze on the margins of manufacturers in the downstream sectors of the PV supply chain. However, the increase in polysilicon prices will soon start to taper off as REC Silicon has restarted production and Wacker Chemie has expanded its capacity. Activities from these major international suppliers will prevent the possibilities of shortages.
Lin said the demand in the polysilicon market remains strong for now, but cooling demand in the downstream sector is beginning to have an impact. The average polysilicon price is expected to reach its peak for this year in early June, then it will weaken afterwards and decline at a gradual pace because of the slowing demand.
Prices of multi-Si wafers have been on a monthly slide because the large price declines in the PV cell market have created downward pressure on multi-Si wafer prices as well. Prices of multi-Si wafers have arrived at RMB 6.2~6.3 per piece in China and US$0.85~0.86 per piece in Taiwan this month. Prices of mono-Si wafers on the other hand are kept high at US$0.92 per piece on account of strong demand. Lin noted that the price difference between mono- and multi-Si wafers is steadily growing, so mono-Si wafer suppliers may start to cut prices in order to continue expanding the market shares of their products.
In the PV cell market, the price downtrend has moderated this month as most cell manufacturers are weighing the overall market condition for June. Margins of cell manufacturers are already very thin and there is almost no room for them to lower their prices further. However, the first-tier manufacturers have expanded their capacities while second-tier manufacturers are facing excessive capacity. For standard cells, EnergyTrend expects their prices to continue to weaken. As for high-efficiency cells, their prices will soon arrive at the threshold of US$0.3 per watt.
Currently, an installation rush is taking place in China as many PV power plant projects in the country have to be connected to grid before June 30, when the changes to subsidy policies will be in effect. Whether Chinese domestic demand will remain strong afterwards will determine the course of the PV module market from June onward and into the third quarter. The Chinese government has yet to make official announcements on this year’s PV installation target, subsidy programs and other specific industry guidance. Hence, the market demand following this year’s SNEC will be uncertain. Vertically integrated first-tier manufacturers will be able to maintain high capacity utilization rates due to having a large customer base and diverse market channels. The outlook for June from the second-tier manufacturers, however, is more pessimistic as they are experiencing noticeable demand slowdown and inventory pressure.
Moreover, developed markets such as the U.S. and Japan are witnessing falling prices, while prices of PV modules in India remain low around US$0.45~0.47 per watt. Even though demand is rapidly growing in the Indian market, it is concentrated on low-priced segments. On account of these developments, EnergyTrend anticipates prices across the PV supply chain to continue to be on a moderate downtrend.

Following the conclusion of SNEC 2016, China’s largest PV industry exhibition, future industry trends have gradually become clearer. With China’s strongly domestic demand in the first half of this year, production has been full. Yet the large amount of grid-connected PV installations during the first two quarters might afterwards sharply cool down China’s domestic demand starting from July. Although India’s demand is expected to remain strong, other markets will go weak and bring a frosty market in the third quarter.
Demand is weakening in the supply chain from downstream to upstream sectors
Polysilicon’s price has increased to RMB 145-148 per kg since the Chinese New Year and squeezed margins for downstream suppliers. As the demand weakens, prices for mid and downstream manufacturers will fall. Therefore, the price of polysilicon has already peaked this year and will be difficult to go skyrocketing again.
Given the fall in PV cell prices in advanced to SNEC 2016, the price of multi-si wafers has decreased on a monthly basis. Since PV cell vendors across the Taiwan Strait are pushing for lower prices, the June quotation has yet to be set. It is possible that the drop in wafer prices could be more substantial than the past two months and fall to below US$0.84 per piece.
There is almost no room for PV cell prices to fall. With demand weakening, downstream clients’ inventory has continued to build up and prices have fallen to US$0.3 per watt. When accounting for the price of wafers, PV cell vendors in both Taiwan and China have razor-thin margins. In addition to the fall in PV cell prices, there has been a continuous flow of news that downstream vendors will cut the volume of their purchases. Beginning from June, some vendors will be unable to maintain a full utilization rate.
During the second half of the year, the quantity of grid-connected installations may be less than during the first half. The third quarter’s installation is consequently not promising. Module vendors generally believe the market will cool from June to August, with prices at around RMB 3.5 per watt、US$0.46 per watt. Also, inventory pileup is continuing, which is causing the prices of overseas modules to fall, too. It is said that some module vendors plan to lower utilization rates. With the exception of no market can drive industry demand except of India, prices in the entire PV supply chain keep falling.
In Taiwan, although the new government shows strong supports for solar energy, supportive policies will need time to come to fruition. It will be difficult for Taiwan’s domestic demand to noticeably grow in the next two years.

                                Price Trend: PV Demand May Cool Down after Price-decreasing June                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160603-10606.html,"

World leading manufacturer of multi-si wafers GCL-Poly reported lower price after SNEC 2016 tradeshow taking place in Shanghai, China in late May, driving multi-si wafers’ price to drop by US$0.02 per piece in June. Consequently, spot prices among every sector in PV supply chain will face significant price downturn.
Besides, rumor had it that China might postpone the grid-connection due date from June 30 to August 31, while it is now widely believed by Chinese PV makers as a rumor. As a result, EnergyTrend expects that the overall PV demand will immediately cool down after the peak demand from PV projects to be grid-connected by June 30.
Polysilicon’s price has already peaked. Although the price will start to decrease, the downward trend will be moderate because of current’s strong demand and full utilization rates. In early June, polysilicon’s prices will fluctuate between RMB 145~148 per kg.
Price of China-made or China-traded multi-si wafers decreased to RMB 6 to 6.2 per piece during this week, which again widened the price gap between multi-si and mono-si wafers. Earlier this year, the price gap between multi-si and mono-si wafers was not large enough for multi-si PV products to maintain its market share. To fight against mono-si wafers’ competitive price, GCL-Poly reported lower quotes for multi-si wafers and help reduce the average spot price in the Chinese market. In the meantime, Taiwanese multi-si wafers’ price dropped to US$0.835 per piece from US$0.85~0.855 per piece in May. As the PV demand will go weak starting from late June, the prices will simultaneously decrease.
As for PV cells’ price, weakening demand forced module manufacturers to increase their module inventory, so PV cell makers had to sell their products at lower prices even there was almost no room for price reduction. In Taiwan, PV cells’ price has dropped to around US$0.293~0.298 per watt. Adding that PV cell vendors procured wafers at relatively high prices, the gross profit of PV cells transacted across the strait has decreased to near zero.
Furthermore, prices of PV cells manufactured in third-party countries were also reduced. China’s first-tier PV manufacturers such as Trina Solar, JinkoSolar and JA Sola have been gradually commencing commercial operations of their overseas manufacturing facilities and reducing cell procurement from other makers’ plant in third-party countries. PV cells made in regions/countries outside of China and Taiwan will not always be the best choice, so the PV cells’ price manufactured in these places dropped below US$0.37 per watt.
China’s PV demand in the third quarter is likely to freeze because, according to EnergyTrend’s forecast, PV capacities to be grid-connected in the second half of 2016 may only represent 50% of or less than the capacities grid-connected in the first half of the year. It is unlikely for the Chinese government to postpone the grid-connection due date to August 31, neither. As PV module makers are mostly pessimistic to market demand in the third quarter, some PV modules were traded under prices at RMB 3.5 per watt or US$0.46 per watt.
Moreover, the high inventory level of PV modules drove price decrease of modules made overseas. Some module makers were said to reduce their utilization rates. In the third quarter, India might be the only market that will sustain a strong demand. EnergyTrend therefore expects a downward trend of spot prices in the whole PV value chain in the upcoming quarter.

China’s PV market remains uncertain as the installation rush in the country comes to the end and the government has not released any detailed plans on domestic PV targets and related subsidies. Therefore, PV manufacturers in China and Taiwan will see sharp drops in incoming orders in late June. Going into the third quarter, there will be no policy pressure to generate installation rushes in major markets such as China, the U.S. and Europe, noted Corrin Lin, assistant research manager of EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. Power plant companies also expect further decline in module prices, so their demand during this period will be fairly cool. With the off season approaching in the third quarter, manufacturers that have expanded their capacities earlier this year will be under a lot of pressure to cut prices.
Seasonality and oversupply will accelerate price decline across the supply chain
The shortage of polysilicon persists in China as most mono-Si and multi-Si wafer suppliers are maintaining full capacity in June. Though the rapid decline of multi-Si wafer prices are already causing some fluctuations in polysilicon prices, the average spot price in the Chinese market during this month will remain somewhere in the level of RMB 145 per kilogram. Midstream and downstream manufacturers have also revised their capacity utilization in anticipation of weakening demand in July. Hence, polysilicon prices will be on a downtrend in the near future.
Mono-Si wafer suppliers have been very active in expanding both their capacities and market shares this year. In response to this growing threat, multi-Si wafer suppliers led by major manufacturer GCL-Poly have started to lower their prices in June. On the whole, the price difference between mono-Si and multi-Si wafers have again widened to near US$0.1 per piece, and the average domestic price of Chinese multi-Si wafers has dropped to RMB 6~6.2 per piece. In the Taiwanese wafer market, the average multi-Si wafer price has fallen from US$0.85~0.855 per piece in May to about US$0.835 per piece in June. The competition between mono-Si and multi-Si products is expected to continue to capture the attention in the market. EnergyTrend expects prices of multi-Si wafers to slide again in the month’s latter half as the downtrend in the overall demand becomes more significant.
Weak demand, falling multi-Si wafer prices and other factors are putting pressure on the PV cell market, even though there is not much room for further price decline. In the Taiwanese cell market, the average ex-factory price has fallen to US$0.293~0.296 per watt. Profit margins of both Taiwanese and Chinese cell makers are now nearing zero. This year, the worldwide cell capacity is projected to expand by 13~15 gigawatts, but the total demand will grow by just 4 gigawatts. For cell companies, the slowing demand will cause substantial challenges for them during this and next year’s off seasons.
First-tier Chinese PV manufacturers such as Jinko Solar, JA Solar and Trina Solar have almost completed setting up their overseas production bases and are scaling back the cell purchases from manufacturing facilities outside China and Taiwan. Hence, cell prices in markets outside China and Taiwan have dropped below US$0.37 per watt.
The third-quarter outlook of the PV module market is negative. The expansion of the worldwide module capacity has been greater than that of the cell capacity. Furthermore, the number of grid-connected power plant projects in China is anticipated to lower significantly in the second half of the year. Foreign module companies are experiencing slowing demand as well. According to Lin, the average module prices in different regions will be on a downtrend to the end of this year because of rising inventories.

                                Multi-si PV Cells’ Price Starts Falling Again, While Demand to Mono-si Products Maintains: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160623-10674.html,"

Chinese markets’ strong demand to PV products has been concluded by the end of installation rush for the June 30 due date. Market demand to multicrystalline PV products significantly decreased, triggering a rapid price drop in this week. In contrast, demand to monocrystalline products was still strong due to better C/P ratio as well as orders for specific projects such as China’s Top Runner Program.
Demand to multi-si gets cool down, while to mono-si is still warm
Currently, polysilicon is in equilibrium between supply and demand. However, polysilicon’s price fell during this week because of frozen demand in the downstream market. Wafer makers are not in any rush to purchase raw materials.
Multi-si wafers’ price rapidly fell along with PV cells’ significant price drop in the recent. In contract, demand to mono-si wafers was still strong in this week and is expected to meet a slight shortage in July. EnergyTrend found that orders for mono-si wafers, cells and modules will remain high in visibility even in July and August.
Nonetheless, the strong demand to mono-si PV products can’t be a drive to mono-si wafers’ price raise. This is because a leading mono-si maker will voluntarily slash its quotes of mono-si wafers starting from July in order to persist on the price gap of RMB0.6 per piece with multi-si wafers. The slashed mono-si wafer price will trigger future price drop across the Taiwan Strait.
As for the PV cell sector, multi-si PV cells’ price fell more significantly than any other sector in the PV value chain. The freezing demand in the downstream market squeezed PV module makers’ orders for multi-si PV cells manufactured by OEM companies, and also lowered the spot price. The later the orders were secured, the lower the spot price was. In July, multi-si PV cells will be manufactured and sold under negative gross profits.
EnergyTrend forecasts that the PV market, especially in China and Taiwan, in the third quarter of 2016 will be in fairly cool. It is still unclear when the domestic demand in China will warm up again. Furthermore, the installation rush ended by June 30 rather than in an earlier period like in the previous years. These two factors accounted for the flat expectation in Q3. Although mono-si PV cell makers will be able to maintain a relatively high spot price during the quarter thanks to stable market demand, it is expected to encounter price fall in Q3 due to the price slash determined by the industry leader in mono-si PV products.
On the other hand, China’s first-tier manufacturers, such as JinkoSolar, JA Solar and Trina Solar, have gradually completed their production capacities in third-party countries. Adding that there is no big surprise in the final ruling of U.S.’s second review of 2012 Anti-dumping and Countervailing duties decision, price of PV cells manufactured in third-party countries has fallen below US$0.36 per watt. PV cells manufactured in overseas facilities are no more guarantee of high gross profit.
As the grid-connected PV capacity in China in the second half of 2016 is anticipated to be lower than in the first half, PV modules’ price has been fallen for weeks. It is visible that PV modules are sold by low price of RMB 3.5 per watt or US$0.46 per watt. The average module prices in different regions will also be on a downtrend to the end of this year because of rising inventories.

In China, installation rush of solar PV systems has been concluded by June 30 so market demand has significantly plunged. PV module manufacturers are difficult to find buyers for their modules, and the order visibility was extremely low during this week. As the module inventory are rising, PV cells’ spot price are suffering from a rapid price fall.
PV products’ prices fell; polycrystalline PV cells’ price at bottom
Although it is currently in supply-demand equilibrium for polysilicon, wafer makers are hesitate to purchase surplus materials due to the weakening downstream demand. This caused price fall in the polysilicon sector. Nonetheless, the price fluctuation in this sector is relatively small.
Price fall in PV cell sector reversely drove the price decline in multi-si wafer sector. In the recent, multi-si wafers’ quote has already fallen below US$0.8 per piece and is expected to drop to nearly US$0.78 per piece. On the other hand, mono-si wafers’ price also dropped because a leading manufacturer promises to keep a price gap no larger than RMB0.6 per piece with multi-si wafers. Starting from July, spot prices of mono-si wafers manufactured or transacted in both China and Taiwan will decline along with the price drop of multi-si wafers until, at least, August. Taiwan-made or –bargained mono-si wafers’ price was at approximately US$0.915 per piece.
PV cells’ spot price significantly decreased due to the weakening demand in the downstream market. PV module manufacturers were slashing orders for polycrystalline cells, and some polycrystalline cells were therefore bargained at prices below US$0.275 per watt, which is the lowest in history of PV value chain and is nearly no margin. Likewise, monocrystalline PV cells, a sector that is still profitable, cannot sustain over the price downturn. EnergyTrend found that some orders were dealt by spot price below US$ 0.31 per watt.
Furthermore, spot price of PV cells made in third-party countries has decreased to US$0.35 per watt and is projected to keep falling because of two reasons: 1) Chinese tier-one PV makers such as JinkoSolar, JA Solar and Trina Solar have gradually completed their production capacities in third-parties countries; and 2) the results of final ruling of U.S.’s anti-dumping tariffs on China PV imports (second review of the 2012 rates) caused almost no impact to current supply-and-demand structure.
Some PV cell manufacturers plan to reduce their utilization rates in response to the drastic price fluctuation. The price fall in PV cell sector was severer than any other sector in the whole PV supply chain.
As EnergyTrend, as well as the whole industry, forecasts that the new grid-connected capacity in 2H16 in China will be significantly less than in 1H16, PV modules’ spot price declined rapidly in past two to three weeks. It was highly visible that PV module makers supplied their products by prices at RMB3.5 and US$0.45 per watt. As the global module inventory kept rising, the price trend is very likely to go downwards until the end of 2016. Especially in the U.S. market where is usually recognized to be more profitable, EnergyTrend projects a 10% price fall rate from June to the fourth quarter of 2016.

PV demand frozen after China’s installation rush ended on June 30. In the third quarter of 2016, order visibility is expected to be very low and inventory of wafer, PV cells and modules will rise. PV module manufacturers encountered sale restrictions so they slashed budget for purchasing PV cells, driving another wave of PV cells’ spot price decline.
PV cells’ quotes at the lowest level in history, below cash costs
Fire incident occurred in REC Silicon’s silane facility in Moses Lake, USA was estimated to cause a slight supply reduction of granular polysilicon in 3Q, while it will not cause severe impact to the sluggish market. In contrast, polysilicon quotes in many markets fell because wafer vendors were not in any rush to purchase extra materials for the frozen demand.
Rapid price decrease in PV cell sector reversely drove price drop in wafer sector. As for multi-si wafers, the spot price has fallen to a level below US$0.78 per piece, and could further decline to US$0.76 and RMB5.7 per piece in late-July and August. Yet the price decline for wafers was more moderate than PV cells.
Price drop for mono-si wafers was not as significant as for multi-si wafers because the market’s demand to mono-si wafers was relatively stronger. As a result, the concessional price offered by the Chinese mono-si leading company cannot offset the enlarging price gap between mono-si and multi-si wafers. Mono-si suppliers need to cut their spot price more significantly or they will be unable to keep a competitive price for expanding market share. Therefore, EnergyTrend expects a rapid price decrease for mono-si wafers in next month.
PV cells’ spot price again fell during this week because of rapidly weakening demand. Some orders for multi-si cells were dealt at price below US$0.27 per watt, which was lower than cash cost and reached the lowest level in the history of PV supply chain. Consequently, the more cells a cell manufacturer produce, the huger the loss will be. Many Taiwanese cell manufacturers and some Chinese second- and third-tier manufacturers have plans to, or already lowered their utilization rates although this decision will increase the manufacturing costs per watt.
The downward price trend and negative outlook to the market demand will lead to a lower utilization rate in August than in July, forecasted EnergyTrend. The weakening demand will continue restricting new orders in near future and officially finish supply shortage in the mono-si cell sector. Hence, mono-si cell manufacturers have to cut their price to win new orders. As the margin was high in the mono-si cell sector in previous months, the price decline in this week was also more rapid than multi-si cells.
On the other hand, it says that Hemlock suing SolarWorld for agreement violation will be possible put uncertain factor to USA’s rulings on China PV imports (a.k.a. USA’s anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar panels and cells). However, EnergyTrend believes that the trade relationship between China and USA will not be transformed suddenly because a potential business earthquake in only one company. Furthermore, if China allowed polysilicon manufactured in U.S. and Europe to import, the stable polysilicon supply-and-demand balance in China would be negatively impacted. It is possible for China and USA to restart negotiations due to Hemlock’s accusation against SolarWorld, while EnergyTrend doesn't regard it as a strongly influential event to the trade situation until, at least, June 2017. Therefore, the spot price of PV cells manufactured in third-party countries will be set depending on real supply and demand.
Spot price of PV cells produced in third-party countries has been decreasing and is possible to drop below US$0.34 per watt. The gradually completed cell capacity deployed by Chinese first-tier cell manufacturers such as JinkoSolar, JA Solar and Trina solar accounted for the price downturn. Motech’s heavy stress to cut U.S.-bounded cells’ price, due to the weak demand, accounted as well.
As the capacity of grid-connection in 2H16 in China is expected to be significantly lower than in 1H, it is difficult to forecast a market warm-up in following few weeks. Both mono- and multi-si PV modules’ prices rapidly declined during this week. It was highly acceptabil for multi-si module makers to receive orders at price of level below RMB3.5 and US$0.45 per watt. As the global module inventory kept rising, the price trend is very likely to go downwards until the end of 2016. Especially in the U.S. market where is usually recognized to be more profitable, EnergyTrend projects a 10% price fall rate from June to the fourth quarter of 2016.

The global PV market has encountered a freeze in demand as it enters the third quarter, and declining orders led to rising inventories for wafers, cells and modules. “Prices in different sectors of the supply chain have kept falling through July due to the lack of demand,” said Corrine Lin, assistant research manager of EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. “The cell prices in particular have reached their historical lows during this off season.” EnergyTrend expects the situation in the August market to turn for the worst, and demand will probably not pick up even by the end of the third quarter.
“Demand in the Chinese PV market will recover much slower in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of past years because the installation rush during the year’s first half caused the market to overheat,” Lin noted. “The accumulation of inventories in different sectors of supply chain in the recent period may further constrain prices from rising in fourth quarter. Since the entire industry is also seeing a general increase in capacity, the coming off season will be very harsh for PV product manufacturers. Besides cutting costs and raising efficiency, they would have to develop effective coping strategies to deal with the rough and tumble market.”
PV cells are sold below their costs as declining prices have affected the entire supply chain
Prices have been the most stable in the polysilicon market compared with other sectors of the supply chain because mono-Si wafer suppliers have generated considerable demand with their capacity expansion efforts. In China, the average spot price has remained fairly high during this month, fluctuating only slightly between RMB 140 and 145 per kilogram. Price trend in China is expected to stay steady going into August. Polysilicon prices outside the Chinese market, however, have fallen a bit since other regional markets do not have trade barriers that interfere with the pricing.
Wafer prices have declined significantly in connection with plummeting cell prices. Nonetheless, both mono-Si and multi-Si wafer suppliers are still maintaining high capacity utilization rates. So far this month, the average trading price of multi-Si wafers has come to US$0.75~0.77 per piece in Taiwan and RMB 5.6~5.8 per piece in China. “Cell suppliers are now competing with prices that are below product costs,” said Lin. “Prices of multi-Si wafers, on the other hand, are on a more moderate downtrend.” EnergyTrend expects that wafer suppliers will experience greater pressure to lower their prices from the latter half of this month through August. The average trading price of multi-Si wafers may eventually dip under US$0.74 per piece.
Strong demand from China has prevented the mono-Si market from experiencing oversupply. Nevertheless, mono-Si wafer suppliers have recently slashed their prices to limit the overall price gap between their products and the multi-Si counterparts. The average trading price of mono-Si wafers in China has arrived at RMB 6.45 per piece this month, maintaining a difference of RMB 0.6 per piece with the price of multi-Si wafers. In Taiwan, mono-Si wafer’s average trading price has arrived at US$0.88 per piece and will continue to fall. Generally speaking, Chinese mono-Si wafers have an enormous cost advantage and their prices can still be adjusted to remain competitive against multi-Si products.
The PV cell market has suffered from depressed demand. For Taiwanese cell suppliers, the high costs of their products put them at an enormous disadvantage against Chinese competitors. The average cell price worldwide has fallen to a new low of around US$0.26 per watt this month, but Chinese suppliers can still tolerate further price decline, unlike Taiwanese suppliers. Since cells are now being produced at a loss, suppliers have also lowered their capacity utilization rates. Compared with Chinese suppliers, Taiwanese cell makers have made larger reduction to their capacity utilization, by margins of 20~40%. Both prices and trading volume are expected to keep falling in August.
In the mono-Si cell market, aggressive pricing from the Chinese suppliers has caused prices to plunge. As for Taiwanese suppliers, product costs are preventing them from accepting most of the mono-Si cell orders. The trading of mono-cells in the Taiwanese market therefore has been very weak.
The PV module market is facing more uncertainties because of the lawsuit between Hemlock and SolarWorld. The entire industry is watching closely at this case because its outcome may also affect the U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar imports. Nevertheless, the development of the lawsuit is unlikely to significantly affect the ongoing trade disputes between the two countries. For now, other PV product manufacturers will observe these disputes from the sidelines and stick to their off-season strategies that address only the most basic levels of supply and demand in the market.
Lin added: “Compared with other segments of the supply chain, the module industry has engaged in the largest capacity expansion this year. Prices have fallen simultaneously in different regional markets as inventories pile up. In most markets, modules have come to around US$0.44~0.47 per watt this month. The U.S., Europe and Japan are the exceptions because module prices in those areas have always been fairly high.”

	Prices have been the most stable in the polysilicon market compared with other sectors of the supply chain because mono-Si wafer suppliers have generated considerable demand with their capacity expansion efforts and multi-Si wafer suppliers only lower a small proportion of production. In China, the average spot price has remained fairly high during this month, fluctuating only slightly between RMB 140 and 144 per kilogram. Price trend in China is expected to stay steady going into August. Polysilicon prices outside the Chinese market, however, have fallen a bit since other regional markets do not have trade barriers that interfere with the pricing.

	 

	Multi-Si wafer prices have declined significantly in connection with plummeting cell prices. In August, the average trading price of multi-Si wafers has dropped below US$ 0.74 per piece in Taiwan and below RMB 5.55 per piece in China. The rough market condition will cause wafer prices to decline further.

	 

	Mono-Si wafer suppliers have recently slashed their prices to limit the overall price gap between their products and the multi-Si counterparts. The average trading price of mono-Si wafers has arrived at RMB 6.1-6.2 per piece in China and US$ 0.84 per piece in Taiwan. Due to high cost advantage of Chinese mono-Si wafers and rapid expansion of two major leading mono-Si wafer companies, mono-Si prices can still be adjusted to remain competitive against multi-Si products.

	 

	The cell market continued to see weak prices in August, with prices reaching below US$ 0.253/W in Taiwan. Since cells are now being produced at a loss, compared with Chinese suppliers, Taiwanese cell makers have made larger reduction to their capacity utilization, by margins of 40% or more. Due to lower manufacturing cost, Chinese suppliers can still tolerate further price decline, with current cell prices dropping below RMB 1.93/W.

	 

	In the mono-Si cell market, aggressive pricing from the Chinese suppliers has caused prices to plunge. Prices have declined below US$ 0.265/W. The rapid decline of regular cells has caused PERC cells and cells made in third-party countries to decline as well.

	 

	Module stock level has increased substantially. Many module makers have stock that can supply more than two months of demand, leading to record low bidding prices for Chinese power plants - RMB 3.2-3.4/W. Due to the lack of exports, second-tier makers had to lower the prices even more, which accelerated the decline in module prices in China.

	Due to rapid decline in cell prices, the mono and multi-Si wafer market witnessed weaker prices. Taiwanese manufacturers couldn’t tolerate prices above US$ 0.72/pc, which put pressures on wafer manufacturers. The average trading price dropped to RMB 5.3-5.5/pc in China. The rough market condition will lead to not only weaker prices but also lower utilization rates for wafers.

The average trading price of mono-Si wafers has arrived at RMB 6.1-6.2/pc in China and US$ 0.83/pc in Taiwan. Following the rapid mono-Si wafer capacity expansion in China this year, manufacturers felt stressed about high inventory level during the low-season.

	 

	The cell market continued to see weak prices in August, with the price reaching approximately US$ 0.24/W in Taiwan. Since cells are now being produced at a loss, Taiwanese cell makers have made larger reduction to their capacity utilization, by margins of 40% or more. Due to lower manufacturing cost, Chinese makers can still tolerate further price decline, with current cell prices reaching RMB 1.8-1.85/W. However, this price is close to the bottom line for Chinese cell makers, and thus some Chinese cell makers may reduce utilization rates.

	 

	Module stock level has increased substantially. Many module makers have stock that can supply more than two months of demand, resulting in record low bidding prices for Chinese power plants. Due to the lack of exports, second-tier makers had to lower prices further, which accelerated the decline in module prices in China.

The average trading price of mono-Si wafers has arrived at RMB 6-6.15/pc in China and US$ 0.8/pc in Taiwan.

	 

	The cell market witnessed the most significant decline in prices compared with other sectors of the supply chain. Multi-Si cell prices could no longer surpass US$ 0.24/W. Since cells are now being produced at a loss, the average utilization rate has dropped below 50% for Taiwanese cell makers. Meanwhile, Chinese makers have also lowered their utilization rate with the cell price reaching RMB 1.8/W. The overall weak demand has caused prices of PERC cells or cells made in a third-party country to drop as well.

	 

	Module stock level has increased substantially. In fact, the total stock has exceeded 3GW for all top-tier Chinese module makers. Therefore, the market still hold conservative attitude toward future price trend even though demand may increase in Japan and China in 4Q16. This has caused module prices to drop further. It’s also the same for overseas module prices. For example, module prices in Japan and the US have declined significantly.

                                Prices across PV Value Chain to Go Decreasing through September: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160821-10896.html,"

PV demand remained weak all over the world, while August and September will be the months with the least demand this year. The high inventory level may not allow price to rebound even if demand starts to pick up in October. EnergyTrend projects a downward trend for PV prices across the value chain through September. Prices for polysilicon and wafer will keep decreasing, and for cell and module will be likely to reach new bottom line.
The Chinese polysilicon market still sees a balanced supply and demand relationship due to slightly lowered utilization rates for first- and second-tier multi-si wafer makers in August. Although polysilicon prices have slightly declined every month after June, spot prices haven’t dropped significantly yet in China, reaching RMB 138-141/kg (approximately US$ 17.7-18.1/kg) recently.
In 3Q16, some polysilicon manufacturers will adjust their supplies through conducting maintenance and lowering production to control the speed of price reduction. Even though conducting maintenance can slightly slow down the price reduction, wafer makers still give polysilicon makers a lot of pressure. It’s estimated that polysilicon prices will start to decline as wafer makers continued to lower their utilization rates.
While cell and module prices declined rapidly, polysilicon prices only declined a little. Therefore, wafer, in between, suffered from chaotic pricing.After some of Chinese second-tier cell makers lowered their utilization rates to around 70%, the stock level for wafer leading company continued to increase. Prices dropped to RMB 5-5.2/pc recently in China.
For Taiwan, multi-Si wafer average trading prices has lower than US$ 0.7 per piece, a price that is already lower than production cost. Such a low price also drove wafer manufacturers with larger production capacity to lower their utilization rates to approximately 70%.
The cell market witnessed the most significant decline in prices compared with other sectors of the supply chain. Multi-Si cell prices could no longer surpass US$ 0.23/W. Since cells are now being produced at a loss, the average utilization rate has dropped below 50% for Taiwanese cell makers. Meanwhile, Chinese makers have also lowered their utilization rate with the cell price reaching RMB 1.7~1.75 per watt. The overall weak demand has caused prices of PERC cells or cells made in a third-party countries to drop as well.

Module stock level has increased substantially. In fact, the total stock has exceeded 3GW for all top-tier Chinese module makers, reducing their utilization rates recently. This has caused module prices to drop to RMB 3.1~3.3 per watt in China. The market still hold conservative attitude toward future price trend even though demand may increase in Japan and China in 4Q16. It’s also the same for overseas module prices. For example, module prices in Japan and the US have declined significantly.

                                Price Decline for Wafers to Speed Up in September Due to Gloomy Market Outlook: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20160826-10916.html,"

PV market momentum in China continues to slow down, while PV demands in the U.S., Japan, and Europe are weak as it entering the latter half of the third quarter. The order volumes are estimated to rise only after demand from China's large-scale PV power stations starts to book products. As a result, the market's overall outlook for the beginning of the fourth quarter is relatively pessimistic. As the price decline across the PV supply chain for this quarter is steep, the quotes in the fourth quarter can only be increased through growing demands after tier-one vendors deplete their inventory.
The prices of polysilicon in each region have been decreasing slowly as expected, and the decrease will lead to further price decline for wafers. Although many tier-one and tier- two multi-si wafer vendors have seen a slight decrease in their utilization rates during August, there might be another drop in utilization rates through September. The low utilization rates of PV cell vendors have caused sudden plummet in wafer trading volume, which in turn led to the steep price declines for this week. Wafer price in China have fallen from RMB 5~5.2/pc last week to RMB 4.7~4.9/pc this week. Meanwhile, Taiwan wafer price is generally lower than US$ 0.68/pc. The price quotes of wafers are getting lower every week.
PV cells have experienced the steepest price decline across the PV supply chain, as most PV cell vendors sold their products below costs. Taiwanese PV cell makers will loss more if they produce more, so many of them chose to slash utilization rates. Currently, the average utilization rates for Taiwanese PV cell vendors are lower than 50%. In China, PV cell vendors are also decreasing their utilization rates, and the situation for next month is projected to be even worse. This will make it more difficult for prices to reach real bottom in September.
Since China’s Top Runner Program requires solar developers to use high efficiency PV cells, there are a lot of order inquiries on mono- and multi-si PERC cells. The volume and efficiency performance of PERC cells made in Taiwan is second to none. However, their prices are still prone to being impacted by the price decline of standard PV cells. Currently, the prices of mainstream mono-si PERC cells have already fallen to US$ 0.28-0.3/W.

PV market momentum in China remains weak, while PV demands in markets such as USA, Japan, Europe and India are also flat. PV order volumes are expected to rise only when the Chinese market restarts booking products for large-scale PV projects and solar bids in the fourth quarter. However, the PV quotes will raise only after tier-one PV vendors deplete their inventory. Adding that the price downturn through the third quarter of 2016 was very severe, it is pessimistic to see a price rebound through October.
Quotes for polysilicon in several regions have started to decline as EnergyTrend’s expectation, and the situation will negatively impact price trend of wafers. Polysilicon is the very last sector that will suffer from market decline across the whole PV value chain, so the price is expected to decrease drastically in the future and will be unlikely to rebound until the end of 2016.
Many tier-one and tier-two multi-si wafer vendors slightly reduced their utilization rates during August, resulting in rise of inventory and price decrease in the beginning of September. The low utilization rates of PV cell vendors have caused sudden plummet in wafer trading volume, which in turn led to the steep price declines for this week. Wafer price in China have fallen from RMB 4.7~4.9/pc last week to RMB 4.5/pc this week. Meanwhile, Taiwan wafer price is generally lower than US$ 0.62/pc. The price quotes of wafers are getting lower every week.
PV cells have experienced the steepest price decline across the PV supply chain, as most PV cell vendors sold their products below costs and will loss more if they produce more. Mono-si PV cells is seeing few orders for September. In addition, the average utilization rates for Taiwanese PV cell vendors are lower than 50% and average price was below US$0.25/W. As the demand remains weak while inventory keeps rising, it is more difficult for cell price to reach real bottom in September.
In contrast with standard PV cells, inquiries on mono- and multi-si PERC cells have been climbing because China’s Top Runner Program requires PV developers to use high efficiency cells. The volume and efficiency performance of PERC cells made in Taiwan is second to none. However, their prices are still prone to being impacted by the price decline of standard PV cells. Currently, the prices of mainstream mono-si PERC cells with 20.8% efficiency rate have already fallen to US$ 0.28/W, and of multi-si PERC cells to US$0.255~0.26/W.
PV modules sold domestically in China were traded in a spot price range of RMB2.95/W and RMB3.15/W, approximately US$0.39/W. The lowering quotes is driving price downturn in markets with higher average selling prices such as U.S. and Japan and presents challenges to global PV module manufacturers.

Despite annual equipment maintenance restraining production volumes, prices on China's polysilicon have tumbled on weak demand, signaling across-the-board price drop in the PV supply chain. The price decline reverses the long-term higher prices on China's polysilicon market, than the international level, due to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy charged on polysilicon imports from E.U., the U.S., and Korea.
Due to sluggish market demand, wafer manufacturers have slashed orders for materials, upsetting prices on China's polysilicon spot prices. While major suppliers still maintain their quotes at around RMB 120/kg, smaller ones have cut their prices to RMB100/kg from RMB130/kg, down by 30% in one month.
Rapid drop in polysilicon prices has induced further sharp price cut for wafers this week, narrowing the price gap between super-high efficiency and high-efficiency wafers. Mainstream multi-si wafers in China now fetch RMB 4.3/pc, compared with US$0.55-0.58/pc in Taiwan. It's expected that spot prices of wafers will drop further in September and October because of the pressure of PV cell manufacturers that have been suffering from the hardest situation across the supply chain amid the sluggish demand.
Most PV cell firms are in deep red due to price drop that are the steepest among the supply chain. As the market demand seems to remain in the doldrums in September, PV cell suppliers have cut prices to under US$0.2/W – a new bottom, again -- in order to lower inventory. The price drop is expected to continue throughout September.
A silver lining is the emerging demand for mono- and multi-si PERC cells stimulated by China's ""Top Runner Program,"" which embraces high-efficiency PV cells. However, price drop of standard PV cells has driven down prices of PERC cells, to around US$0.28/W for mono-si PERC cells with conversion efficiency of 20.8% and US$0.25-0.255/W for multi-si PERC cells.
China’s domestic spot prices for PV modules have slipped to RMB 2.95-3.15/W, or US$0.39/W. Affected by the Chinese market, prices in the U.S. and Japanese markets have also declined sharply, posing a major challenge to module firms worldwide.

Despite an upturn in demand, PV module prices have plunged further in September, as suppliers scrambled for orders during trade fairs in India and the U.S. Indian buyers have demanded further cut into quotes, already at low level, driving down average prices for PV cells and modules to record lows. Even in the U.S. market, used to feature higher prices thanks to anti-dumping and countervailing duties, spot prices have dropped conspicuously, due to acute competition and launch of capacities in third-party countries enjoying free tariff to the U.S. market.
The price drop has spread to the mid- and upstream sectors. In the Chinese polysilicon market, featuring limited transaction volume, prices are in a chaotic state, having even dropped reportedly to under RMB 100/kg in some cases. With the situation having started to affect other markets, global polysilicon prices are in for another round of drop.
Multi-si wafers have suffered steepest price decline recently. Although Chinese first- and second-tier suppliers have cut their capacity utilization rates to near 50% and planned to resume production only after China’s National Holidays, high inventory is sufficient to meet market demands, putting a damper on transaction prices. Mono-si wafer prices have stagnated, at RMB 5-1.1/pc in China and US$0.66-0.69 in Taiwan, as further price cuts cannot stimulate demands.
PV cells have negative gross margin, among the sectors with the deepest price drop. Despite some upturn in demand prior to and after Mid-Autumn Festival, suppliers have cut their prices to new lows, in order to reduce inventories, as settlement date for Q3 financial reports is drawing near. Price drop for PV cells in China has moderated, with prices now ranging RMB 1.5-1.55/W, but many orders in Taiwan are still priced below US$0.195/W.
As prices are now lower than cash costs, more business means more loss for suppliers, which will moderate price drop in the future and prompt PV module suppliers switching to higher-performance products. Some module suppliers have bundled 5-busbar PV cells with a larger size (156.75mm*156.75mm), while others demanded over 18.4% conversion rate for standard PV cells, prompting PV-cell suppliers to upgrade their products.
Domestic spot prices for PV modules in China have slipped to RMB 2.95-3.1/W, or around US$0.39/W. Prices in the U.S. have shed over 25% so far this year and average prices in Japan and E.U. have also plunged. Average module prices have plummeted in general recently.

PV product manufacturers in Taiwan and China saw orders returning in the second half of September, while prices of polysilicon, wafers and PV cells started to rally after reaching their lows, according to EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce. The capacity utilization rates of many manufacturers also rose from under 50% back to 70~80%. As the Chinese government has planned to significantly cut its renewable energy subsidy in the middle of 2017, EnergyTrend expects the country’s PV system installation demand to take off again towards the end of 2016.
Prices in Chinese PV market rose as demand recovered ahead of National Day holidays
Chinese PV enterprises did not have the sufficient manpower to increase their production to meet a short-term increase in demand that occurred just before China’s National Day holidays in October. This has led to a temporary rebound of domestic prices for polysilicon, wafers and cells. Taiwanese PV product manufacturers are also being affected by the situation and are preparing to raise their prices as well.
“Whether prices in China will continue to go up after the National Day holidays will depend on a policy announcement from the country’s National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) regarding grid connection targets for new energies,” said Corrine Lin, assistant research manager of EnergyTrend. “NDRC’s announcement will be instrumental in triggering a new surge of installation demand.”
The first major PV industry tradeshow following China’s National Day holidays will be PV Taiwan, which will last from October 12 to 14. This event will be an important indicator of the market demand situation in China and worldwide.
There are concerns that rising prices in the upstream and midstream sectors of the PV chain will be a temporary development as the first-tier manufacturers have yet to fully utilize their production capacities. EnergyTrend’s latest analysis finds that the market is jolted by China’s plan to further cut its PV subsidy, so the overall demand will be fairly strong from the end of 2016 to the first half of 2017.
June 30 will again be the day that divides the hot and cold phase of the Chinese PV market next year
On the other hand, manufacturers in different sectors of the PV chain have also massive expanded their capacities in 2016, so they are more than ready to meet China’s installation rush that will begin at the end of the year. Looking ahead to 2017, supply will continue to outpace demand through the year. Prices will likely remain in a slump even if there are periods of significant increases in orders.
“Most manufacturers are expected to receive sufficient orders to survive through the fourth quarter of 2016, but prices are still too low for them to achieve profitability,” noted Lin. “Furthermore, China and India will continue to drive the global demand from the end of this year to the first quarter of 2017. U.S. and European PV enterprises will not benefit from these two major markets, where depressed prices are the norm. Hence, they are currently reducing their workforces to save costs. By contrast, some Chinese and Indian manufacturers still have plans to expand their production capacities.”
Chinese industry participants would prefer their government to reduce subsidy at a gradual pace in 2017 as to avoid a repeat of this year’s progression – an installation rush during the first six months followed by a demand freeze in the latter half of the year.
“Nonetheless, the Chinese government through several statements has indicated that a major reduction in subsidy will be in effect by the end of June 2017, which will mark the end of the next wave of installation demand,” Lin added. “Even if the actual subsidy cut might be smaller than previously announced, the Chinese PV market will generally follow the demand pattern of this year. Hence, manufacturers across the supply chain will have to keep improving their cost efficiency during the period of strong demand in the first half of 2017. By being vigilant, they will be able to cope with the inevitable price slump in the second half of next year.

PV Taiwan 2016, held during Oct. 12 ~ 14 in Taiwan, was the first large PV tradeshow in Asia-pacific region since China's National Holidays. This tradeshow has generated a lot of interests and lively discussions, and was an indicator to future price trend across the PV value chain. According to data collected in the tradeshow, prices for min-stream products have obviously taken off due to short-term imbalanced supply-and-demand. Manufacturers' expectation to price uptrend in October is optimistic.
The market has become busy. Recently, entire supply chain has gradually escalated its utilization rates. PV cell manufacturers’ utilization rates even swelled more rapidly. The strong demand toward high conversion efficiency products has led to urgent price hikes for ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafers. During this week, price for multi-si wafers in China has surpassed RMB 4.4 / pc, and in Taiwan has come above US $0.56 / pc, representing a three percent price increase scale showed up in simply one week. The highs of spot price even exceeded US $0.6 / pc. As of now, ultra-high-efficiency wafers are still highly in demand. The price is estimated to keep on growing in the coming two weeks as a result.
Mono-si wafers experienced a demand recovery as well, while most of the supply has come from tier-one suppliers. Price raise in multi-si wafers drove fast bouncing upwards significantly, and spot price has regained ground at a firm US $0.7 / pc and would steadily move up.
As mono- and multi-si wafer prices have quickly up-swung, PV cells quotes will also reflect their rising material costs. After China's National Holiday, mono-si PERC cells’ price began to pull up first due to their supply shortage. For PV cells with standard conversion efficiencies, the spot prices were generally raised to around US $0.29 / W. Regarding to mono-si PERC cells with higher efficiency above 21%, the prices became much greater than prior price US $0.3 / W. Spot price for multi-si PV cells with efficiency above 18.4% will see a comparable trend by reaching US $0.21 / W very soon, and will open up a bigger lead from standard PV cells.
Following China’s holidays, downstream side has not seen huge installation demand. Although mid-stream of supply chain product price started to grow, the industry has concerned that price hike was only tentative. EnergyTrend predicts that the demand side will experience a new installation mania from November 2016 to Lunar New Year of 2017, because China would slash subsidies by July 1st 2017.
Although prices for wafers and cells both significantly raised after China’s National Holiday, the PV industry eventually must return to its fundamental supply-and-demand. Overly glutting caused module price to continuously fall. Even though cell and wafer makers have seized the moment to raise their prices, they may soon encounter the pressure of price cut again. Their next opportunities will be at the end of year 2016, when the market will start to swiftly procure in a huge quantity. That will be the time to break through price ceiling and to surface another wave of price increase.

Following the step last week, spot prices in the PV supply chain spiked further this week, not only in the up- and midstream sector but also for China's domestic PV modules, a trend expected to continue into first half of November.
China's polysilicon prices started to rise after the country’s National Holiday, with spot prices having hit RMB 110-115/kg, which induced upturn of polysilicon prices in other markets. With annual maintenance of some Chinese polysilicon plants putting a damper on supply, polysilicon prices are expected to advance further to beyond RMB 120/kg and might meet some resistance to the mark of RMB 125/kg.
Upturn in demand has enhanced the overall capacity utilization rate across the supply chain but supply for high-efficiency wafers is still insufficient, as some wafer makers have yet to resume full capacity. Price for ultra-high efficiency multi-si wafers climbed further to US$0.65/pc, and overall price for multi-si wafers would continue rising in the next two weeks.
Mono-si wafer suffers the most serious supply shortage in the supply chain, due to inability of first-tier supplies to meet market demand. Their spot price therefore boosted to US$0.75/pc, with no sign of letup.
PV cells’ spot prices have spiked according to wafer price’s raise, with price of mono-si PERC cell having hit US$30/W and that of multi-si cell having risen even more steeply to US$0.21/W, or around RMB 1.65/W in China. Prices of high-efficiency multi-si PV cells with conversion efficiency of 18.4% (and above) are expected to reach US$0.22/W soon. On the other hand, price hike of mono-si cells was relatively moderate with current price of around US$0.23 ~ 0.245/W.
It has been widely believed that Chinese government would slash PV subsidies after June 30, 2017, so EnergyTrend expects that the market demand could remain brisk from November through Chinese Lunar New Year holiday next year. On top of rapid prices hikes of polysilicon, wafers, and PV cells after China’s National Holiday, PV module prices in China have also risen to RMB 2.9~3/W. However, judging from the bid price for China’s recent solar bids, Chinese module prices will encounter strong resistance when approaching RMB 3.2/W. As a result, price growth may stop in mid-November. Companies therefore will face major challenge to rise prices in the fourth quarter.

	FiT rates may be lowered in China at around June 30th or September 30th 2017 and the market didn’t seem to be affected by it this week. The increase in module orders continued to boost the number of orders for mid-to-upstream sectors. Last week, the market remained conservative toward demand in October, but this week, most manufacturers have confirmed their prices for November. This caused prices to increase significantly in just one week and may keep rising till mid-November.

	 

	The spot price of polysilicon has increased to RMB 120/kg, allowing polysilicon prices to rebound in other markets as well. Although most Chinese manufacturers are running at full capacities, some makers are going through equipment maintenance, leading to limited supply. Prices may be able to increase further to RMB 120-125/kg, stimulating wafer and cell prices.

	 

	While overall suppliers are running at full capacities, many multi-Si wafer and cell manufacturers can only keep their utilization rate at 80%. It’s too late for them to optimize their capacities to respond to the rising demand, allowing prices in mid sectors to increase the most among all other sectors of the supply chain. Wafers with higher qualities suffered from short supply, resulting in a surge in mono-Si, super-high and high-efficiency multi-Si wafer prices. The average trading price of mono-Si wafers mostly surpassed US$ 0.76/pc and higher than US$ 0.64/pc for multi-Si wafers.

	 

	The rapid increase in wafer prices has reflected on cells. Not just PERC cell prices exceeded US$ 0.34/W; the multi-Si cell market saw more significant increase in prices this week. The average trading price of normal cells reached US$ 0.22/W and US$ 0.23-0.24/W for multi-Si cells with efficiency above 18.4%. As for China, it’s about RMB 1.85/W. Multi-Si PERC cells with higher efficiencies witnessed continuous increase in prices too.

	 

	Module manufacturers started the production for low-priced orders received previously, boosting the number of orders for mid-to-upstream sectors. However, demand from end-users wasn’t strong enough to allow prices to keep increasing. Therefore, module price stayed flat at RMB 3/W in China, while overseas module prices reflected a downtrend. In addition, due to limited price increase, rapid price rebound for mid-to-upstream sectors, and compressed module profits, prices may soon hit the ceiling for mid-to-upstream sectors of the supply chain. Price increase will face stagnation by mid-November. Manufacturers will be in huge challenges in 4Q16.

With trading remaining brisk, overall prices of the PV supply chain has kept on rising this week, with prices of silicon wafers scoring the steepest hike, due to serious shortage of supply.
Polysilicon prices on China's spot market has hit RMB 123-125/kg. However, there are only a few transactions on the spot market, due to insufficient supply, as majority of Chinese polysilicon factories have yet to run at full capacity, following their annual maintenance.
Silicon-wafer plants are running at capacity but still cannot meet demand, jacking up prices. Multi-si wafers are being transacted at prices above RMB 5/pc, or US$0.68/pc, with transaction prices for silicon wafers with especially high performance ranging US$0.69-0.74. Thanks to price stabilization policy of first-tier suppliers, prices of mono-si wafers stand at US$0.76-0.78/pc, despite grave shortage of supply.   
Affected by the price spike of silicon wafers, prices of mono-si PERC PV cells have topped US$0.35/W, while multi-si PV cells have scored even steeper rise, to over US$0.22/W. Prices of high-efficiency multi-si PV cells, with conversion rate exceeding 18.4%, have advanced to over US$0.235~0.25/W, or RMB1.85/W on the Chinese market. Due to insufficient supply of silicon wafers, prices of regular mono-si PV cells are rather chaotic, ranging RMB1.9-1.95/W, with prices for quite a few orders in Taiwan surpassing US$0.25/W.
Module firms have no other choice but accept prices hikes by PV cell suppliers, in order to fill orders which must be delivered by the end of the year. On the other hand, as end demands have remained moderate, they cannot pass the higher costs to customers, as a result of which module prices have stayed at around BMB 3/W on the Chinese market, with overseas prices even trending downward further. As a result, margin of module firms has dropped to razor-thin level, which will put a damper on further price hike by midstream suppliers. Midstream prices are expected to stagnate or even start a downturn in mid-November.

                                Multi-Si Cell Market Reaches Ceiling Price, While Mono-Si Continues to See High Demand: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20161110-11159.html,"


	Due to the reduced number of multi-Si orders, multi-Si products will no longer witness increasing prices within mid-sectors of the supply chain this week. EnergyTrend believes multi-Si wafers and cells will soon suffer from slight decline. Prices for mono-Si products will have more support because of higher demand.

	 

	Polysilicon prices have risen to more than RMB 125/kg in China. Although most Chinese polysilicon manufacturers have completed conducting their equipment maintenance, supply has not yet stabilized, leading to slight supply shortage for polysilicon. The average trading price of polysilicon remained between RMB 125/kg and RMB 130/kg.

	 

	As manufacturers continuously release their wafer capacities this month, multi-Si wafer is not in short supply. Even though manufacturers have revised their prices upward, the actual trading prices may no longer increase. The average trading price of high-efficiency multi-Si wafers reached RMB 5.2-5.3/pc (US$ 0.68-0.70/pc). Meanwhile, mono-Si wafers suffer from serious supply shortage. Just like multi-Si wafers, top-tier mono-Si wafer makers witnessed slight increase in prices, but the price increase has slowed down, reaching US$ 0.77-0.79/pc.

	 

	Pressured by the rising prices from downstream sectors, the cell market has reached the ceiling price this week. The average trading price of multi-Si cells with efficiency above 18.4% reached US$ 0.235-0.25/W and RMB 1.85/W in China. The price gap is quite large between Taiwan and China. Normal mono-Si cell prices reached RMB 1.9-1.95/W and more than US$ 0.25/W in Taiwan.

	 

	The module market has witnessed weaker prices this month despite some of the orders waiting to be delivered by the end of this year. Top-tier module makers saw lower profits in 4Q16. Looking ahead for the future, Donald Trump’s electoral victory will bring many uncertainties to the future demand in the US. Also, China’s 13th Five-Year Plan may slow down the future growth in China. All of these will bring more uncertainties to the overall PV demand from 2017 to 2018. Given this, how to adopt more advanced technology as well as more flexible strategies in order to survive in such fluctuating environment is something PV makers keep working on.

                                Prices in PV Supply Chain Have Peaked and Expected to Drop in Late November                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20161117-11185.html,"









Product orders are tapering off across the PV supply chain as some projects that are required to connect to the grid before the year-end deadline are almost completed. Though polysilicon, wafer and cell prices have been on the rise during the past one and half months, the market demand has cooled down a bit. Corrine Lin, assistance research manager of EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, stated that prices of polysilicon, wafers and cells will soon experience a small decline.
“With the exceptions of Japan and India, no installation rush will be taking place in most regional markets in the first quarter of 2017,” said Lin. “Therefore, prices of PV products are unlikely to go up again before the next Chinese New Year holidays due to the lack of stock-up demand.” EnergyTrend’s latest analysis finds that prices in PV supply chain may start to fall in the second half of this November, and the downward price trend will continue into the first quarter of 2017.”
Prices of multi-Si wafers have peaked in November while demand for mono-Si wafers stays high
In China’s polysilicon market, prices are currently kept high at RMB 130~135 per kilogram. While most Chinese polysilicon suppliers have completed the annual maintenance of their production facilities, it will take time before these factories will return to full operation. Polysilicon supply therefore will remain a bit tight in the short run.
Wafer production capacity on the whole has increased in November and the supply of multi-Si wafers is sufficient. While quotes for multi-Si wafers are still on the rise, the actual spot prices have peaked. Currently, prices of high-efficiency multi-Si wafers have come to RMB 5.2~5.3, or US$0.68~70, per piece.
The PV cell market has been influenced by the falling prices in the downstream markets. In November, multi-Si high efficiency cells with conversion efficiency of 18.4% and above have seen their prices peaked around US$0.238~0.25 per watt. Quotes for same products in China have also stayed around RMB 1.85 per watt.
“The widening price gap between Taiwanese and Chinese cell makers means that the anticipated drop in demand will first affect Taiwanese cells,” said Lin. “The rest of PV supply chain will again look to the price trend of Taiwanese cells as a market indicator. Spot prices of standard mono-Si cells worldwide have remained stable during November, residing in the range of US$0.25~0.26, or RMB 1.9~1.95, per watt.”
Prices of PV modules are on a freefall and product margins have been eroded significantly for major manufacturers. A survey of orders for modules to be delivered next year indicates that module prices will drop below US$0.38 per watt in 2017.
Prices next year will be heavily influenced by China’s deadline for grid-connection and policies of the new U.S. administration
China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) have made some changes to its second draft document regarding opinions on the country’s feed-in-tariff (FiT) program. The document, which was released in late October 2016, contains a proposal to move back next year’s deadline for grid connection, from the originally expected June 30 to September 30, 2017.
“If the Chinese government adopts this proposal, then country’s PV plant developers will moderate their pace of system installation next year,” Lin noted. “Under this scenario, the supply chain will not experience a general price surge between from the first to the third quarter of 2017 because demand in China will more evenly distributed throughout the year compared with the situation in the first half of 2016.”
In addition to China not having definite FiT policies for next year, the result of the U.S. presidential election has also created a lot of the uncertainty in the U.S. solar demand. “Globally, the market outlook for 2017 has become murkier, but capacity expansion will occur in all sections of the supply chain,” said Lin. “Since the entire solar industry expects prices to be on a sharp downtrend next year, individual PV enterprises will be working hard to further reduce their costs.”

With demand for PV installations beginning to wane on the advent of winter, PV prices are in somewhat confusion. Prices of overseas modules dropping further, those of upstream polysilicon continuing to rise, and midstream prices wavering, as players are waiting for wafer and PV cell suppliers to put forth quotes for December, according to EnergyTrend.
An uncertain factor is China's decision to review once again the anti-dumping duty rates on South Korean polysilicon imports. Blockage of import from South Korea will aggravate shortage on China's polysilicon market and jack up prices. The case will not affect the market in the first half of 2017, since it is still in the investigation stage.
After completion of repair and maintenance, some Chinese polysilicon plants still cannot meet demands and strained supply on the market persists, as some plants have reduce output in preparation for repair and maintenance in December. Therefore, polysilicon prices have risen to RMB 135-138/kg.
Supply of multi-si wafers has been sufficient, following release of new capacities in November. While some second-tier Chinese suppliers have cut prices slightly, most suppliers are still embracing a wait-and-see stance and trend of multi-si wafer prices in December won't become clear until leading player GCL-Poly has offered its quotes.
Strong pressure from the downstream sector has led to slight price cut for PV cells but transaction amounts are limited, as trend for multi-si wafer prices remains unclear. Prices of high-efficiency multi-si PV cells, with 18.4% or higher conversion efficiency, range from US$0.235-0.24/W now, which are expected to drop slightly. Quotes on the Chinese market stand at RMB 1.8-1.85/W. Prices of regular mono-si PV cells are steady, reaching US$0.25-0.255/W in Taiwan and RMB 1.9-1.95/W in China.

	Midstream sectors began to have clear pricing as leading multi-Si wafer companies announced their latest price quotes. According to EnergyTrend’s observation, while the polysilicon market continued to witness rising prices, the multi-Si wafer market that suffered from price decline kept experiencing squeezed profit margin. On the other hand, due to the devaluation of the renminbi, PV cell prices in Taiwan and overseas declined more significantly than Chinese cell prices.

	 

	Although the review of China’s anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed on overseas polysilicon imports may not have impact just yet, the Chinese polysilicon market experienced slight supply shortage because some makers couldn’t fill up their supplies after completing equipment maintenance and some have just started to lower production and conduct maintenance. The average trading price of polysilicon slowly reached RMB 140/kg. Overseas polysilicon prices are picking up as well. However, due to the decline in multi-Si wafer prices, polysilicon prices will peak in December and can no longer increase further in January 2017.

	 

	The decline of multi-Si wafer prices has led to lower overall prices. Due to the devaluation of the renminbi, Chinese multi-Si wafer prices dropped US$ 0.02/pc to US$ 0.65-0.66/pc in Taiwan, while prices stayed flat at US$ 0.67-0.68/pc for Taiwanese multi-Si wafers pressured by the rising polysilicon prices. Meanwhile, multi-Si wafer is priced at RMB 5.05-5.15/pc in the Chinese market. Since demand slightly lowered for downstream sectors, multi-Si wafer prices may decline further in the future. As for mono-Si wafers, prices will remain stable owing to strong end-user demand.

	 

	Since the decline of multi-Si cell prices in US dollars is more substantial than in renminbi, non-Chinese cells also saw significant decline in prices. The average trading price of high-efficiency cells dropped to US$ 0.23/W in Taiwan. This also affected the prices in countries outside of China and Taiwan. Although some manufacturers lowered cell prices slightly following the decline in wafer prices, the overall cell is priced at RMB 1.8-1.85/W.

	 

	For modules, despite the slight increase in Chinese prices, global module prices continued to reflect a downtrend due to weak trading volume during year-end holidays in the European and US markets. In addition, manufacturers have reported that prices will decline significantly in 1Q17; therefore the world is expecting weaker module prices in 2017.

	Although it’s rumored that the 2017 deadline for grid-connection in China may change back to June 30th, the rising prices in the entire supply chain from October to November has led to weak stock offload under such high prices. According to EnergyTrend’s observation, the average trading price of multi-Si wafers and cells have declined in December. As demand cools down in the European and US markets, the overall market will see weaker demand as well. Therefore, the prices are expected to reflect a downtrend before the Lunar New Year.

	 

	Slight tight supply situation remained in the Chinese polysilicon market. But as mid-to-downstream prices dropped further, the rise of polysilicon prices have slowed down. The average trading price of polysilicon stayed flat at RMB 135-138/kg. Since the price of multi-Si wafers has declined, polysilicon prices should peak in December and may no longer increase further in January.

	 

	Last week, the price of Chinese multi-Si wafers was adjusted by US$ 0.02/pc. This week, Taiwanese wafer makers followed suit. The average trading price of multi-Si wafers reached US$ 0.64-0.67/pc in Taiwan and RMB 5.0-5.1/pc in China. Because downstream demand slightly weakened, multi-Si wafer prices will drop further. Although the mono-Si market still witnessed slight supply shortage, the price gap has become larger between mono and multi-Si wafers. As a result, mono-Si wafer prices may be slightly revised in order to avoid affecting the future market share growth of mono-Si wafers.

	 

	Following the decline of multi-Si wafer prices, the price of high-efficiency cells dropped below US$ 0.23/W in Taiwan, also affecting the cell prices in third-party countries. Although some Chinese cell prices slightly dropped to reflect the decline of wafer prices, multi-Si cell was priced at RMB 1.8-1.85/W. Due to the significant decline of PERC module prices, the average trading price of mono-Si PERC cells dropped below US$ 0.33/W, no longer saw high gross margin like last month.

	 

	Even though the price of Chinese modules slightly increased, global module prices continued to reflect a downtrend due to weaker demand during the year-end holidays in the European and US markets. Deducting the freight fees, there’s barely a price gap among the US, European, Japanese, and Chinese markets. Module prices in the Indian market has dropped below US$ 0.32-0.35/W. On the other hand, manufacturers have announced that prices will still decline substantially in 1Q17. In other words, next year will remain challenging.

	Price support remains in China in December, According to EnergyTrend’s observation. Multi-Si wafers and cells from the overseas saw significant decline in prices after mid-December. Prices are expected to keep declining before the Lunar New Year.

	 

	The Chinese polysilicon market still witnessed short supply. Some manufacturers have increased their prices to more than RMB 140/kg. In fact, it’s because they don’t have that many supplies to sell. The average trading price of polysilicon reached RMB 135-140/kg. Since multi-Si wafer prices have started to drop, it’s estimated that polysilicon prices will peak in December and will begin to decline in January 2017.

	 

	Due to the depreciation of renminbi and lower cell prices, multi-Si wafer prices continued to reflect a downtrend in Taiwan. The average trading price of multi-Si wafers reached US$ 0.64-0.66/pc in Taiwan and RMB 5.0-5.1/pc in China. As downstream demand slightly turned weaker, the multi-Si wafer market will still see decline in prices, temporarily widening the price gap between multi and mono-Si wafers. On the other hand, supply shortage remained for mono-Si wafers. As a result, mono-Si wafer prices may be slightly revised in order to avoid affecting the future market share growth of mono-Si wafers.

	 

	Following the decline in multi-Si wafer prices, Taiwanese cells with efficiency above 18.4% are priced below US$ 0.23/W in late-December. Cells with efficiency of 18.2% also declined by US$ 0.05/W compared to last week. Mainstream cells are still priced at RMB 1.8-1.85/W in China. Yet, second/third-tier Chinese makers saw more substantial decline in prices. Meanwhile, due to lower PERC module prices, the average trading price of mono-Si PERC cells dropped below US$ 0.32/W, no longer saw high gross margin like last month. Price drop will be more significant in January 2017.

In contrast to the continuing price hike for polysilicon in China, downstream module prices on various markets have trended downward in December, putting a damper on the price level on the overall supply chain, including multi-si wafers and mono- and multi-si PV cells, with the exception of mono-si wafers, due to serious shortage of supply.
Although most Chinese polysilicon factories have resumed production following completion of annual maintenance, polysilicon has still been in short supply in China, due to the effect of reviewing of anti-dumping investigation against South Korean polysilicon import. With transaction price of some orders having hit RMB 140/kg in China, most suppliers have limited inventory for selling. Spot prices range RMB 136-138/kg in China, compared with the range of US$13.3-15.5/kg in Taiwan. Although prices are believed to have peaked and expected to drop subsequently, prices will remain stable in the short term, due to price settlement for orders in first half of January.
Price drop of multi-si wafers, alongside that of PV cells, has been suspended, as high polysilicon prices have cut margin of multi-si wafer suppliers to razor-thin level. Multi-si wafer prices have stabled at RMB 5.0-5.1/pc, compared with US$0.63-0.66/pc abroad. Due to continuing serious shortage in supply, prices of mono-si wafers have stayed high ranging US$0.80-0.85/pc.
PV cells suffered steepest price drop in the week and the downward trend will not be reversed until the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, clouding hope of multi-si PV cell (with conversion efficiency rate of 18.4%) suppliers to keep prices above US$0.22/W. While mono-si wafer prices have stayed high, mono-si PV cell prices have declined rapidly and only mono-si PERC cells have remained profitable. Plus shortage of mono-si wafers, most PV cell firms have refused to accept orders for standard mono-si PV cells.
Except continuing price decline for standard PV modules, mono-si PERC modules have also been mired in acute price competition, as integrated factories have cut their quotes to less than US$0.4/W, prompting non-integrated factories to offer comparatively low quotes. It is expected that high price/performance ratio of PERC modules will keep demand high for overall mono-si supply chain. Except mono-si wafers, margins of PV cells and modules have declined conspicuously, clouding the outlook of the high-performance market.

Continuing price hike for polysilicon in China during December significantly raised wafer's cost, found EnergyTrend. Mono-si wafer has been in a serious shortage of supply, so its price stayed peaked. Multi-si wafer price nearly stopped falling as well. Combination of the two factors put enormous pressure on mid-stream cell manufacturers.
Polysilicon in the China market still saw under-supply. Some small-volume orders' spot price reached RMB 140 / kg. However, most of manufacturers have not enough supply to sell, so their real spot price ranged RMB 137~140 / kg. As to polysilicon prices in Taiwan, most of them ranged US $13.3~15.5 / kg. Prices are predicted to be at their peak already, and the price trend will turn weaker. However, orders for the first ten days of January are done with negotiation, so in the short run, prices will remain stable.
Multi-si wafer prices fell along with PV cell prices in the recent. Nonetheless, the price fall scale has shrunk recently. Multi-si cell prices in China maintained steadily at RMB 5.0~5.1 / pc, while prices in Taiwan mostly ranged US $0.63~0.66 / pc.
Currently, many mid-and-down-stream manufacturers continued to shift multi-si fab capacity to produce mono-si products. This move intensified the under-supply issue of mono-si wafer, and thus it eroded the total amount of mono-si wafer that Taiwanese manufacturers can procure. This has posted a toughest issue to solve in the near future.
Moreover, the newly expanded capacity of Xi’an LONGi and CMC will hit the market in second quarter of 2017. Therefore, mono-si wafer will continue to see severe shortage in the first quarter of 2017. For the short term, prices will stably peak at US $0.80~0.85 / pc, and they will hardly decrease.
Cell sector's prices fell the most among all sectors this week. Multi-si cell prices with 18.4% conversion efficiency dropped to US $0.21~ 0.215 / W, hitting the edge of cost. Hence, some Taiwanese manufacturers slightly modified downwards their utilization rates. As to mono-si cells, peaked mono-si wafer prices only allowed mono-si PERC to be profitable. In contrast, general mono-si cell prices already dropped to below cell costs. Some cell manufacturers therefore chose to give up standard mono-si cell orders, so that they might survive in this in-sufficient mono-si wafer supply.

The installation rush for solar systems in China has not appeared, and the market demand to modules stays flat. Nonetheless, EnergyTrend predicts that the rush will surely come because the recent policies continuously stimulate Chinese domestic market demand in first half of 2017. After the Chinese New Year Holidays, China's domestic market demand will show stronger procurement momentum, and make entire supply chain to be busy.

For the whole January, orders for solar products across the supply chain has mostly been dealt due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, and EnergyTrend found that the spot prices did not, and will not, significantly fluctuate in the recent.
The strong, expected demand in Chinese market drove many Chinese solar companies to maintain their capacity utilization rates even the Lunar New Year holiday is around the corner. Meanwhile, some Taiwanese solar makers will reduce workforce on duty during the holiday because of low-level prices. Nonetheless, it is forecasted that supplemental orders will be dealt after the Lunar New Year in Taiwan.
Chinese market’s demand to polysilicon will remain strong through February, with the price to stick at around RMB 140 per kg. Price for polysilicon in China is expected to maintain at a higher level in the short run because solar installations will centralize in the first half of this year, as well as some manufacturers’ utilization rate reductions resulted from the high-level price. EnergyTrend projects that the Chinese market’s demand to polysilicon will still be strong amidst this year’s installation rush. In China, the future price for polysilicon will be bargained according to volume of restarted capacity and quality of newly-expanded capacity.
Multi-si wafer’s price has been fixed at around RMB 5~5.05 per piece, or US$ 0.63~0.64 per piece, in the past few weeks, while procurement orders for January have mostly been placed at prices at the same level. Wafer makers tend to deliver products ahead of their original schedules this month to fulfill inventory need; likewise, some solar cell makers prefer receiving wafer products earlier this month because they will stop manufacturing during the holiday. However, most cell manufacturers are relatively conservative to volume of their inventories, resulting that wafer manufacturers will be unlikely to receive large-volume orders until early February.
Mono-si wafer’s price, in the contrast, is still high because strong demand to mono-si PERC cells, which sustains demand to mono-si wafers, despite the continuous price reduction in cell and module sectors.
Prices for both monocrystalline and multicrystalline solar cells keep going downward. Spot price for multi-si cells with efficiency of 18.4% dropped to approximately RMB 1.7~1.73 per watt, or US$0.21~0.215 per watt. Margin of solar cells has been squeezed because the unchanged wafer price level and the downward cell price level. EnergyTrend therefore forecasts that price for multi-si cells will immediately rebound as soon as the market has warmed up, and the market warm-up is expected to emerge in early-to-mid-February at the earliest.
Spot price for mono-si PERC cell have been decreasing due to its huge price gap between multi-si cells. Nonetheless, mono-si PERC cell’s price will return to a stable level along with multi-si cell price’s rebound.

Prices across the PV supply chain gradually stop fluctuating as it is close to the Lunar New Year. Most Chinese solar vendors will continue manufacturing products during the holiday, while some Chinese polysilicon and Taiwanese PV cell makers will reduce production capacity due to low-end price level, bringing slight supply shortage afterwards. Consequently, prices for wafers and PV cells may increase after the Lunar New Year, expected EnergyTrend.
Price for polysilicon in February may start decreasing due to expanded capacities, yet it is possible to remain at a high level of RMB 140 per kg in China. It is even possible for certain product price to peak to RMB 142~143 per kg, due to a forecasted strong demand driven by China’s installation rush by June 30, 2017. In the short term, polysilicon price will stay at a relatively higher level in China, which will also sustain non-China polysilicon to be traded at approximately US$14~15.5 per kg.
Procurement for multi-si wafers for January has already ordered with a stable price range of RMB 5~5.05 per piece, or US$ 0.63~0.64 per piece. However, possible supply shortage of super high-efficiency multi-si wafers may lead to a price hike due to inventory needs during, as well as production suspension during the Lunar New Year.
Furthermore, supply shortage of mono-si wafers is unlikely to be lessened through the first quarter of 2017. If price for multi-si wafers increases, the price gap between mono-si and multi-si wafers will again be reduced, helping maintain price level of mono-si wafers in short-term supply shortage.
Spot prices for mono-si and multi-si cells have both converged to stable level during this week, of which multi-si cells with 18.4% conversion efficiency at RMB 17.~1.73 per watt, or US$ 0.21~0.215 per watt, and standard mono-si cells at around US$0.24 per watt. However, spot price for mono-si PERC cells have generally dropped below US$0.3 per watt.
Such a bottom-leveled price enhanced volume of cell purchase from module manufacturers, worsening the supply shortage of mono-si cells. In addition, it is becoming difficult to buy China’s local-made PV cells. As a result, EnergyTrend forecasts that prices of both multi-si and mono-si cells will rebound immediately after the New Year holiday, when will be in early February.
Mono-si PERC cells’ price would be the exception because margin and spot price of mono-si PERC cells are both higher than standard cells. The price gap between mono-si PERC cells and standard cells will be too large to eliminate even though spot prices for standard cells would increase in early February. EnergyTrend expects price for mono-si PERC cells to be restricted at the same level in the short term.
Price trend for PV modules would remain flat due to oversupply, despite the upward trend in mid-stream sectors. Spot price of modules in Chinese market could be sustained or slightly increased thanks to the nation’s strong demand, while in other markets would go downwards. The flat price trend for PV modules may restrict scale of price raise in the mid-stream sectors, too.

Lunar New Year Holidays are coming and spot prices across the entire PV supply chain have maintained stably. However, most of PV manufacturers predict that both si wafer and PV cell will increase their prices after the Lunar New Year. Thus, some module makers began to procure small quantities since early January. The gradually rising demand triggered price to rise ahead of time. Spot prices of si wafer and PV cell both moved up during this week.
The PV industry generally assumes that polysilicon price will turn weak because capacity will reach full utilization rates starting from March. Nonetheless, mono-si ingot capacity still hit 100% utilization. That was why in China polysilicon will stay under-supply until February. Spot prices grew to RMB 140~143 / kg.
Si wafer orders usually get finalized one or two months in advance. Therefore, as of in the first ten days of February, polysilicon price is predicted to remain stable while rising a little bit. Non-China region's polysilicon higher pricing orders will stay at US$ 14~15.5 / kg.
Multi-si wafer prices of China and Taiwan increased in sync. In China, quote prices ranged from RMB 5.05 / pc to RMB 5.15 / pc. In Taiwan, quote prices showed a mix of signals, while super-high-efficiency multi-si wafer price hit US$ 0.66~0.69 / pc.
Because some multi-si wafer foundries will not fully operate during Chinese New Year Holidays. Ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer might keep on accumulating price rising momentum because it experiences a slight undersupply. Its price might fully reached US$ 0.68 /pc after the Lunar New Year Holidays.
The supply shortage issue of mono-si wafer hasn't showed any signs of relief in first quarter of 2017. If multi-si wafer price starts to rise, the price gap between multi-si wafer and mono-si wafer will narrow. Then, even though mono-si wafer is in shortage, in the short run, mono-si wafer's price will remain stable
If mono-si wafer price rises along with multi-si wafer price, then standard mono-si PV cell cost will continue to increase. That means, only PERC will offer better cost/performance ratio among the mono-si wafer products. In such scenario, if standard multi-si PV cell’s profit is higher than standard mono-si PV cell profit, then mono-si PV cell makers cannot fulfill their goal of continual market share growth by only relying on PERC products. The current market's lop-sided preference on mono-si PV cell might change its direction.
Mono-si and multi-si PV cell prices both rose this week. Multi-si PV cell (18.4% conversion efficiency) price rose to US$ 0.215~0.22 / W, while standard mono-si PV cell price climbed to US$ 0.245 / W. In China, quotes also kept on increasing. Multi-si PV cell price reached RMB 1.8 / W, and mono-si PV cell price ranged from RMB 1.95 / W to RMB 1.98 / W.

In early January 2017, price hit rock bottom and rebounded, so some module makers set off to increase procurement momentum to PV cells. Thus, price rise took place faster than expected. After the Lunar New Year, PV cell price will continuously rise along with China’s installation rush.
Although the mid-stream product prices began to grow, module prices hardly move up due to overwhelming capacity. Merely China's demand is strong. The rest regions' module prices remain weak.

Spot prices for mid-stream PV sectors have accelerated rising since last week and PV cell price increased more rapidly than other sectors due to former loss. Prices for monocrystalline products, which are still in supply shortage, even surged.
Polysilicon supply in China will be in shortage through February due to continuous capacity expansion of mono-si ingot and wafers, resulting in higher spot price ranged RMB 142~145 per kg. Si wafer orders usually get finalized one or two months in advance. Therefore, as of in the first ten days of February, polysilicon price is predicted to remain stable while rising a little bit. Non-China region's polysilicon higher pricing orders will stay at US$ 14~15.5 / kg.
Multi-si wafer prices in Chinese and Taiwanese markets increased in sync. In China, quote prices ranged from RMB 5.15 to RMB 5.3 per piece. In Taiwan, quote prices showed a mix of signals, while super-high-efficiency multi-si wafer price would be up from US$0.68 per piece.
Because some multi-si wafer foundries will not operate at full rate during the Lunar New Year Holiday, ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer might keep on accumulating price rising momentum under a slight undersupply. Its price might reache US$ 0.69 per piece after the Holiday.
Supply shortage of mono-si wafers will not be tackled until April since LONGi and Zhonghuan, the two leading manufacturers, schedule to complete their capacity expansions during March and April. In the short-term, price of mono-si wafers will raise with a moderate step.
Mono-si and multi-si PV cell prices both rose this week. Price for multi-si PV cell with 18.4% conversion efficiency rose to US$ 0.22 per watt, while price for standard mono-si PV cell significantly climbed to US$ 0.25~0.28 per watt under supply shortage. In China, quotes also kept on increasing. Multi-si PV cell price reached RMB 1.8 / W, and mono-si PV cell price ranged from RMB 1.95 to 1.98 per watt.
Such an upward trend restricts sale volume of PV cells this week as many cell manufacturers targeted at potential price hike after the Holiday driven by China’s installation rush.
In contrast with mid-stream sectors, PV module price remained flat due to oversupply. Global PV module prices have, and will go downwards except for in China, where the module demand is strong.

                                PV Market Witnesses Stagnation in Prices After Lunar New Year: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170209-11440.html,"


	Although the Lunar New Year holiday has ended, employees in China will have to wait until the Lantern Festival to return to work. In addition, power plant installation has been suspended in China during the Lunar New Year holiday, leading to slightly higher module inventory level. Therefore, Chinese demand has slightly declined after the Lunar New Year. The European and US markets also witnessed weak demand in 1Q17. The overall market remains conservative toward demand.

	 

	According to EnergyTrend’s observation, both upstream and downstream sectors are still testing the prices in early-February. But judging from a potential installation of over 25GW in China this year, there should be a major stock offload in 1Q17, which may keep prices up.

	 

	Currently, multi-Si wafer price has slightly increased compared to before the Lunar New Year but still suffers from chaotic pricing. The average trading price of multi-Si wafers reached RMB 5.15-5.3/pc in China and US$ 0.66-0.69/pc in Taiwan. That of mono-Si wafers reached US$ 0.82-0.85/pc in Taiwan and RMB 6.2-6.3/pc in China.

	 

	Due to the weak cell trading volume after the Lunar New Year, the mono and multi-Si cell market saw stagnation in trading prices. Even though the price quote of 18.4% multi-Si cells has reached US$ 0.223-0.228/W, the average trading price remained at US$ 0.22/W. Conventional mono-Si cell saw slightly higher price rise before the Lunar New Year, and thus the current price can be maintained at US$ 0.25-0.28/W. The weak trading volume has caused cell makers to prepare less stock and try to sell most of their on hand stock. However, EnergyTrend projected that cell prices may increase again as demand rises in late-February.

	 

	Module prices may be difficult to pick up recently. Although module makers are hoping to increase prices following the rise of cell prices, module prices have not been seen up in almost all of the markets. Therefore, module makers’ profits are shrinking. If prices can’t pick up during the installation boom in March, it may bring pressures to mid-to-upstream sectors, leading to limited price increase for multi-Si cells. The trend won’t be clear until installation boom takes place from late-February to March.

                                Mid-stream PV Price Suspends Increasing and Trend Will Remain Obscure through March: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170216-11461.html,"









PV demand after the Lunar New Year has slightly cooled down, spot prices for mid-stream sectors hence suspended the upward trend prior to the holidays. Adding weaker demand in the U.S. and European markets, the overall price trend is trapped in a wait-and-see situation. Mid-stream manufacturers generally hold less confidence in increasing product price in the short term.
EnergyTrend found that manufacturers across the PV value chain have been exploring adequate price ranges since the early February. As for the PV cell sector, orders have relatively decreased so cell vendors can only raise the spot price when it appears stronger demand.
Demand to multi-si PV cells is too weak for multi-si wafer manufacturers to raise their spot prices. In the Chinese market, spot price for multi-si wafers ranged RMB 5.15 ~5.25 per piece, while in Taiwan stayed between US$ 0.66 and US$0.69 per piece. Both remained flat over previous weeks. In contrast, supply shortage of mono-si wafers helped the spot price to increase gradually to US$0.82~0.85 per piece, and RMB 6.2~6.3 per piece, respectively in Taiwan and in China.
Due to less cell procurement after the Lunar New Year, strike prices of both mono- and multi-si cells stayed at the same level. Although quotes for multi-si cells with 18.4% conversion efficiency has topped to US$0.223 to 0.228 per watt, the products were still traded at around US$0.22 per watt. Standard mono-si cells’ price had rapidly increased before the holidays, while the price range has stuck at US$ 0.25 ~ US$ 0.27 per watt.
Furthermore, PV cell vendors chose to sell as many products as possible instead of piling up extra stocks because of weak procurement. This situation is likely to remain through next month so price trend until early March is difficult to clarify now.
Same to cell sector, PV module prices would be unlikely to raise. Module prices in seasonally weak-demanding U.S. and European markets kept decreasing, while in China, some PV developers offered lower price to win bids for large-scale PV power plants. Consequently, price trend of PV modules will remain flat until emergence of solar installation rush.

                                Prices to Reflect a Downtrend Due to the Absence of Installation Boom: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170223-11481.html,"










	The Chinese market has started to hold bids for power plants in February. Judging from the winning prices, modules prices have declined. The winning price for 5MW of Hanwha’s 280W mono-Si modules reached RMB 2.91/W (US$ 0.362/W) and that for 100MW of Jinko’s 270W multi-Si modules reached RMB 2.88/W (US$ 0.358/W), continuously adding pressure to the market price.

	 

	According to EnergyTrend’s observation, since many utility-scale power plants haven’t started the operation, demand is lower than expected in February. Module makers face great pressure as module price is rumored to reflect a downtrend. Because module manufacturers’ marketing costs are higher than those of midstream and upstream sectors, they must maintain a profit of about 15% for their orders. But as module prices continue to decline, module makers can only put pressure on cell prices. Therefore, some module makers plan to pay a lower price – US$ 0.05/W (RMB 0.04-0.05/W) for cells this week. Although most cell makers haven’t accepted the bargain, cost reduction is inevitable in the absence of installation boom.

	 

	Multi-Si wafer manufacturers have noticed that cell prices will soon weaken; they will not raise the prices in March. The average trading price of multi-Si wafers reached US$ 0.66-0.68/pc (RMB 5.1-5.15/pc). Yet, judging from US$ 0.215/W, cell makers can’t accept multi-Si wafers that cost more than US$ 0.66/pc. Multi-Si wafer makers must have to deal with serious bargain later on.

	 

	Like downstream sectors, upstream sectors will soon witness the decline in prices. Polysilicon is expected to face price decline. Although polysilicon is priced at RMB 142-145/kg, with some reaching RMB 147/kg in March, prices should have reached the highest point this year as they are about to face price drop.

	 

	Looking ahead for the future, price decline is inevitable for the entire supply chain in the short run. Demand will remain weak during the peak-selling season from February to March. The PV market can only hope that installation boom takes place as soon as possible. Since total Chinese demand may still reach 25GW this year, if demand remains weak in March, demand should begin to increase from April to May, which may lead to stable prices for midstream sectors.

	The Chinese market continues to witness weak demand in March because installation boom hasn’t appeared as anticipated. According to EnergyTrend’s observation, the lower-than-expected Chinese demand from February to March has led to high inventory level for cell and module makers. Since module manufacturers’ marketing costs are higher than those of midstream and upstream sectors, they must maintain a profit of 15% for their orders. But as module prices continue to decline, module makers can only put pressure on cell prices. Therefore, the multi-Si cell market saw the most significant decline in prices this week, down US$ 0.05-0.1/W to US$ 0.208-0.21/W (RMB 1.65-1.68/W).

	 

	Due to the weaker multi-Si cell prices, the average trading price of multi-Si wafers has slightly declined in March, reaching US$ 0.05-0.1/pc. Yet, judging from US$ 0.21/W, cell makers can’t accept multi-Si wafers that cost more than US$ 0.64/pc. Cell makers will have to keep bargaining with multi-Si wafer makers later on.

	 

	Both cell and multi-Si wafer makers have started to face cost war, but multi-Si wafer prices remained high and may begin to drop later.

	 

	Looking ahead for the future, the price decline of multi-Si products is inevitable in the short run. For mono-Si, due to the short supply of mono-Si wafers, wafer and cell prices have stayed flat. On the other hand, cell and module makers have to re-examine if they should make some adjustment to the operating rates in response to inventory adjustment. However, the absence of installation boom has made manufacturers worry about the market demand in April. Manufacturers are also trying to figure out the reason to the absence of installation boom. As a result, prices will reflect a downtrend in the short-term.

China’s installation rush has yet emerged until early March as expected, while PV supply chain have started fluctuating. Strong demand to mono-si products drove the prices to hike during this week; by contrast, spot prices for midstream multi-si products decreased nearly to their production costs.
EnergyTrend discovered that market demand to mono-si products remained strong through March, hence sustained the gradual prices raise. Orders and spot price of mono-si PV cells have remained at a stable level. Spot price for mono-si PERC cells maintained at around US$0.31 per watt.
However, spot price for multi-si cells fell. Due to the absence of installation rush, China’s overall market demand in early March was not as strong as expected, causing the downward trend of multi-si cell’s quotes. Current multi-si cell price in Taiwanese market has fallen below domestic makers’ costs. Even for Chinese multi-si cell makers who enjoys lower production costs, it is struggling for them to strive for positive margins.
Significant price decrease in multi-si PV cell segment pressed multi-si wafer makers. In early March, price for multi-si wafer have fallen to about US$0.64 per piece. Although multi-si wafer makers wish to maintain the price above US$0.63 per piece, or RMB 5 per piece, EnergyTrend projects that they have to cut price in near future because of stresses caused by multi-si PV cell vendors.
China’s moderate market demand, even in prior to June 30, will force multi-si wafer and cell makers to renegotiate quotes with upstream polysilicon manufacturers, who still have good margin. In the short-term, polysilicon price will remain at the same level with it is now because polysilicon orders for early March were dealt in February. However, polysilicon’s price trend will be likely to go downwards along with multi-si wafers’ price decline in late March to the soonest.
As for the market outlook, price decline across the multi-si PV value chain will be highly possible. Flat market demand and excessive capacity expansion in the past one year both account for this situation. EnergyTrend forecasts that the multi-si prices may see greenlight only after China’s SNCE tradeshow to be held in April.

Solar-grade polysilicon became sufficient in supply due to production capacity recovery. However, price and order drops of multi-si wafers forced polysilicon price to slightly decrease during this week although relatively strong demand to mono-si wafers has helped sustain the price. EnergyTrend expects that polysilicon price will go down to near RMB135 per kg.
China’s installation rush ahead of June 30 has yet come, brings none extra demand through March. This may be relative to some factors such as land use restrictions. Also, China offered additional installation targets in the very last week of 2016 and many companies have filed for the extra FIT subsidy. However, it has been yet unveiled whether the filed companies are qualified for additional FIT subsidy or not, until now.
Multi-si wafer’s price has dropped to around US$0.63 per piece, and ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer’s price fell to US$0.66 per piece as well. The foreseeable price decline in polysilicon sector would relief cost pressure on multi-si wafer makers. Nonetheless, downstream demand will ultimately be crucial for the quotes to raise or to fall.
During this week, multi-si PV cell’s price in Chinese market was almost the same with in last week, contrary to in Taiwanese market, where the quote has fallen below manufacturing costs. Taiwanese multi-si cell makers can only opt to reduce their utilization rates. In March, most Taiwanese multi-si cell makers have reduced their utilization rates to 50% to 60%, those that operate at rate of approximately 70% are relatively rare. However, such a utilization rate decline would become moderate soon, expected EnergyTrend.
Mono-si products are unable to except themselves from the overall price decline trend. This week, price of mono-si wafers dropped a little by US$0.05~0.1 per piece, driving average selling price of mono-si PV cells to decrease to around US$0.248 per watt in China. On the contrary, Taiwanese market was suffered from supply shortage of mono-si wafers so the quote increased by US$0.1 per piece.
PV modules, which have been encountering issues of weak demand, is facing stress of piling up inventory. For both multi-si and mono-si PV modules, their quotes averagely fell by US$0.002 per watt in the past week.
In China, the lowest bid prices for multi-si and mono-si modules for large-scale PV power plant auctions have already fell below RMB 3 per watt. EnergyTrend expects that mono-si products’ price could be maintained at a stable level due to continues market demand, but multi-si products will confront deeper price pressure as long as there comes no stronger demand in near future. It is unavoidable for multi-si wafer makers to transfer cost pressure to polysilicon sector. As for the mid- to downstream sectors, margin of multi-si PV cell makers has already been over squeezed so PV cell sector’s price drop would slow down by late March, unless module sector’s inventory pressure increased.

The overall solar PV demand was weaker than expected during the first quarter of 2017, so it is unsure if the downward price trend could be reverse in April, found EnergyTrend.
Polysilicon’s price started decreasing last week and through this week, down to RMB 137~139 per kg. EnergyTrend forecasts that polysilicon price will gradually but moderately fall. The price would ultimately drop to a level of RMB135 per kg by the end of March given the steady demand from mono-si sector.
Multi-si wafer sector’s price decrease rate was still steep even polysilicon’s price has started to fall. Some super-high-efficiency multi-si wafer manufacturers even suspended offering their quotations in this week because the price was too bad. Downstream market demand is unlikely to turn warm in the short term, either. As a result, high-efficiency multi-si wafer’s price could drop below US$0.60 per piece in next week. Likewise, quote of mono-si wafers offered by some manufacturers dropped by RMB 0.02~0.03 per piece although in slight supply shortage. The average quote for mono-si wafers has declined by US$0.005 per piece in this week.
Quote level of multi-si PV cells maintained over the past week. However, multi-si cells’ spot price has decreased to US$0.198 per watt due to inventory piling-up. In the meantime, price of mono-si PV cells in this week was stuck at almost the same level with in last week because of supply shortage of mono-si wafers.
However, Chinese PV manufacturers are truly cutting orders for mono-si PERC cells, which would lead to a flat price trend through March for both multi-si and mono-si PV cells. Whether PV cells’ price would rebound in April will be determined by two factors: first, if the downstream demand would go stronger, and second, if SNEC to be held in Shanghai in April would stimulate procurement.
In Taiwanese market, many local PV cell makers has reduced their utilization rates for inventory and operating costs control since March. Nonetheless, order cuts by Chinese manufacturers causes severe impact on Taiwan PV cell makers. EnergyTrend expects that price of PV cell sector will go downturn in near future.
As for PV modules in Chinese market, price of multi-si PV modules with power output of 270W has already dropped below RMB 3 per watt. While the price decrease only reflected a scale of US$0.001 per watt in the past week thanks to RMB exchange depreciation. Price of mono-si PV modules also dropped by RMB 0.02~0.03 per watt compared with in last week, also being forced by sluggish market demand.

	The PV market continued to witness weak demand in March, leading to lower-than-expected demand in 1Q17. Polysilicon prices started to decline slightly in mid-March. This week, the polysilicon market saw more significant decline in prices. Most top-tier polysilicon makers performed long-term contract production, resulting in less active price quote. The trading volume remained low, with the market being in wait-and-see mode. The average trading price of polysilicon has dropped below RMB 130/kg this week and may decline further in April.

	 

	The wafer sector saw continuous decline in prices this week. The average trading price of super high-efficiency multi-Si wafers dropped substantially to below US$ 0.60/pc this week, while that of high-efficiency multi-Si wafers declined RMB 0.02-0.03/pc to RMB 4.7-4.8/pc. Last week, the price gap between super high-efficiency and high-efficiency wafers reached US$ 0.03/pc, but there’s barely any price gap between the two this week.

	 

	The sales of multi-Si wafers this week was similar to polysilicon, with the trading volume remaining low. In addition, the inventory level has slowly piled up for multi-Si wafers. Order visibility also remained unclear for April. For mono-Si wafers, prices stayed flat and will continue to remain stable in April.

	 

	The cell market witnessed stable prices but weak demand this week. The average trading price of cells reached US$ 0.20/W. Since multi-Si wafer prices may decline in April, cell maker’s price pressure will be alleviated. Taiwanese manufacturers may be able to raise their capacity utilization rates. For mono-Si cells, due to the continuous short supply, some manufacturers have begun to produce multi-Si PERC cells in order to increase PERC capacity utilization rates.

	 

	Module prices stayed flat. But due to weak end-user demand, the module market held conservative attitude. Module makers hope demand may increase in April owing to China’s installation boom before June 30th.

The recent dynamic of the solar power market reflects a recovering demand, yet this week prices in different sectors of the supply chain witness different changes. The price of polysilicon continued last week’s pattern- light trading due to quotations not being made public- and it slid by 4%, compared with that of last week, at the range of RMB 112-115/kg. Whereas, as there shows a sign of increasing orders from end customers, that should slow down the price decline.
It is a seemingly good sign that the market sentiment is buoyed by the recuperating demand; however, in the PV cell market, the price is yet to be made public though the supply is ready. The price of PV cell of this week still slightly slides; the price in the Chinese market decreases by RMB 0.05/w, leading the average price to drop off from US$ 0.20 to USD$ 0.196.
The upstream multi-si wafer industry pretty much witnesses similar price change. This week, the average prices of ultra-high-efficiency and high-efficiency multi-si wafer come at US$ 0.59/ pc and US$ 0.58/ pc respectively. In April, major multi-si wafer manufacturers operate with full capacity for the significant number of orders received, while a part of manufacturers still struggle clearing their stocks. The price of silicon wafer does not seem likely to bounce back until silicon wafer suppliers clear their stocks and the demand grows stronger.
Mono-si wafer wise, as the supply of mono-si wafer still stays tightened and the prices of silicon wafer and pv cell remain unchanged, its price in April is projected to plateau. Still, the price will be likely to go up if the demand increases.
A new wave of strong demand at the end of Q2, namely 630 demand momentum, will slowly heat up the demand. Therefore, despite no sign of recovery, the slump of the prices of mono-si and multi-si modules stopped. The market is recouping, but the mood would possibly stay reserved until the end of April, or even May.

China’s installation rush by June 30th has revived market demand beginning from last week. However, the speed of rising has been slow. Thus, price of polysilicon remained falling this week. Some price quotations even fell below US $ 13/kg. Nevertheless, because the restoring demand, after inventory has been consumed, polysilicon's price will be stabilized with limited price drop.
Multi-si wafer price finally stopped moving down after post-Chinese-New-Year. The market expected a positive outlook of ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer, so its quote price rebounded. Nonetheless, general high-efficiency multi-si wafer has not experienced market demand recovery's orders. In other words, the Chinese installation rush has not apparently increased the multi-si wafer's demand. Tier-two and –three manufacturers saw their accumulated inventories. With respect to tier-one giant manufacturers, even though their orders have been scheduled to mid-April, their future order volume is to be observed. Therefore, multi-si wafer's market demand in April has not been quite clear. In respect of the price of high-efficiency multi-si wafer this week, some manufacturers slightly adjusted their prices by about RMB 0.02/pc.
Currently, multi-si PV cell price has dropped below the cost. Lowering the cost is an immediately necessary action. That was why diamond-wire slicing demand became higher. The major manufacturers have proactively arranged their production schedules. After they reach mass production phases, the pressure of the multi-si PV cell segment should be effectively eased.
The restoration of demand starting from last week made module price this week stable. Mono-si PV module price stayed at a relatively high point because PV cell segment supply was constrained by supply shortage of mono-si wafer.
If the Chinese installation rush by June 30th brings stronger order demand toward mono-si PV modules, the price is somewhat likely to slightly rise. PV cell price did not show a huge change this week. If SNEC in Shanghai in the coming week attracts pouring-in orders for manufacturers, then multi-si PV cell price might rebound.

                                Demand for Mono-Si Modules Surges on June 30 Installation Rush                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170420-11638.html,"









Thanks to the effect of the facility installation rush before the June 30 deadline, demand has picked up, though at slower-than-expectation rate, in the wake of the long holiday in early April. Prices of multi-si wafers have stabilized this week, when prices of multi-si modules still dropped slightly. Further price decline will be limited, given the expectation for a rush of demand. Mainstream price of first-tier suppliers has steadied at RMB 110/kg, which, though, is expected to experience a new round of decline from mid-May, following subsidence of the June 30 installation rush.
The price slide of multi-si wafers after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday has finally come to a stop. Thanks to rosier market outlook, quotes for ultra high-performance multi-si wafers have stabilized, with some dealings carried out at around US$0.60/pc this week, when prices of common high-performance multi-si wafers still dipped by RMB 0.02-0.05/pc, or US$0.002-0.005/pc.
With gradual upturn in demand, quotes for multi-si cells remained flat, as most suppliers have been unwilling to cut quotes. Trend for SNEC prices will become clear soon. Driven by June 30 installation rush, prices will peak at early May. In the wake of reduction of equipment utilization rate by some Taiwanese suppliers, quotes increased slightly this week. Due to limited spot supply, quotes are being made on the volume of supply in early May. Mono-si demand has remained robust. With demand favoring PERC products amid the June 60 rush, Taiwan-made mono-si PERC prices rose slightly, at around US$0.005-0.008/pc, a trend which may continue until mid-May.
With module prices having become almost uniform worldwide, prices of mono-si modules remain relatively high, with average prices dipping only by US$0.001/w, thanks to insufficient supply of wafers. Should demand for mono-si modules pick up further amid the June 30 installation rush, their prices may rise slightly, along with price hike of mono-si PERC. Multi-si module has yet to benefit from the June 30 installation rush, as its price slid by around US$0.004'w this week, underscoring sufficient inventory. However, its price may pick up, should orders flow in after SNEC fair.

China’s installation rush in advance to June 30 has finally appeared after the SNEC 2017 tradeshow held in Shanghai. This week, spot prices for mono- and multi-si segments across the whole value chain has slightly rose, respectively, including polysilicon.
Price of polysilicon stopped declining and rebounded to an average of US$13.7 per kg, or a mainstream price quote of RMB 110 per kg. Nonetheless, polysilicon’s price is expected to witness another downturn starting from mid- to late-May due to demand cool down.
Multi-si wafer sector, which ultimately stopped its price decline since this year’s Lunar New Year, saw a moderate price rebound this week. A limited volume of super high efficiency multi-si wafers have been traded and the average price was US$0.593 per piece. As for high efficiency multi-si wafers, the price quote also rose by US$0.002 per piece and there is still room for it to increase in early May.
Price rise of multi-si solar cells was visible during this week. After SNEC 2017, both quotes of high-efficiency and standard multi-si solar cells increased by RMB 0.02 per watt, while quote of Taiwan-made high-efficiency multi-si solar cells enjoyed stronger price jump of approximately US$0.01 per watt. EnergyTrend expects that price of multi-si solar cells will continue this upward trend until early May. After this time point, the price trend may sustain until it starts to decrease.
In contrast, mono-si segments’ price trends, including module sector, were overall stable due to supply shortage of mono-si wafers. Price of mono-si PERC cells was the only exception with a quote increase rate of US$0.01 per watt.
280W mono-si PV modules’ price was almost the same with the prior week, while we have found that 290W modules’ quote has slightly increased by US$0.002 per watt.
Quote of multi-si modules has rebounded by RMB 0.02 per watt to an average price of US$0.361 per watt. EnergyTrend forecasts another wave of price increase before the demand boom for the June 30 installation rush has ended, yet the ratio could be limited.

Demand boom drove by China’s installation rush in advance of June 30 continues. During this week, PV module sector was the only exception to the overall price rise across the PV value chain.
Upstream PV sector saw relatively strong price rebound. EnergyTrend found that price of polysilicon has maintained at approximately RMB 100 per kg, a similar level with in last week. Although it is expected that polysilicon’s price will further rise, this trend will unlikely be realized until the second half of this week due to less trade volume within the May-first holidays.
Being benefited from the demand boom by June 30, quotes of ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafers has converged to US$0.60 per piece, while price of standard multi-si wafers has also been stimulated to rise. Taiwan-made multi-si wafers’ price has significantly rebounded, and China-made products’ price has increased by RMB 0.01 ~0.02 per piece. Multi-si wafers’ price can be further go upward if price of multi-si cells continues to increase and release more room for price rise.
Multi-si cell sector was the winner among this wave of demand boom since both high efficiency products and 18.2% efficiency products saw price rise. Taiwan-made high-efficiency multi-si PV cells have increased their price to US$0.21 per watt. On the other hand, price of Taiwan-made standard multi-si cells, whose rise scale was larger than China-made ones, has increased by US$0.002~0.004 per watt and lessened the makers’ business stress caused by loss.
Price of mono-si PV cells continued to increase, and quote of Taiwan-made mono-si PERC cells even topped US$0.325 per watt.
Lat but not the least, quote of PV modules has maintained at the same level with in the last week. Stronger demand from the end market could help boost the price.

PV industry’s upstream and downstream manufacturers have boosted their shipment near the mid-May, in order to satisfy orders by June 30th in China. However, procurement momentum on the demand side has gradually weakened. Thus, each section of supply chain began to shrink their price rise scale.
Polysilicon price broke a threshold, surpassing RMB 115 per kg. Production capacities have recently reached full utilization rates, and nearly all production schedules of May were booked. As a result, the price is expected to remain at around RMB 115 per kg. However, the market expects that PV demand after June 30th will cool down, so price rise scale was limited during this week.
Benefited by Chinese installation rush by June 30th, ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer and high-efficiency multi-si wafer almost have all of their capacitis booked. Ultra-high-efficiency si wafer price quotation maintained at US $0.60 per pc. In China, high-efficiency multi-si wafer manufacturers tried to raise price quotation up by RMB 0.03-0.05 per pc. Moreover, currently there are no inventories of high-efficiency multi-si wafer, if there are any rush orders, prices might see another wave of hiking.
For now, most of si wafer manufacturers' shipment schedules have been booked to the early June. If the wave of procurement momentum begins to weaken, another wave of price fall will show – starting from the first ten days of June to the latest. Moreover, under-supplied mono-si wafer price quotation slightly rose up by RMB 0.03-0.08 per piece this week because end-market demand stayed hot.
Regarding to PV cells, most manufacturers had received maximum orders. High-efficiency multi-si PV cell price quotation increased by RMB 0.02-0.05 per watt. If any manufacturer still has surplus inventory to ship out, the price quotation is estimated to exceed RMB 1.7 per watt very soon, an equivalent to US $0.21 per watt.
Standard multi-si PV cell price quotation stayed the same as that in the previous week, not much differences. Mono-si PERC cells price quotation has amounted to US $0.325 per watt. Few manufacturers managed to surpasse US $0.33 per watt.
As to module sector, procurement momentum has slowed down, so the price quotation remained consistent to that in last week. Strong sales momentum will have to depend on rising end-market demand.

                                Restricted Supply Helps Price Rise across the PV Value Chain: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170518-11712.html,"









PV orders have been booming for more than three weeks after SNEC 2017 tradeshow, gradually balancing supply and market demand across the PV value chain. Polysilicon sector has already gotten rid of pressure of oversupply so its spot price rose in a moderate step during this week like in last week.
In the prior two weeks, polysilicon sector suffered from uncertainty of market demand. However, this situation has changed. Currently, polysilicon price reached RMB 116 per kg and will continue rising because polysilicon makers are encouraged by bright market condition. EnergyTrend expects polysilicon price to reach RMB 120 per kg by the end of May and to go downturn again through June due to market shrink.
Price of wafers kept rising. Super high efficiency multi-si wafer’s price makes no concessions to the price of RMB 4.7 per piece with strong influence of leading wafer makers. Wafer buyers can only accept the high-leveled price and then transfer the extra cost to their buyers in the downstream segments since the shipment deadline for rush demand ahead of June 30 is around the corner.
Mono-si wafers for the demand by June 30, furthermore, have been almost booked except for a few volume that can only be purchased via costly channels. There have been no mono-si wafer in stock for the trade market for several weeks.
Restricted supply triggered price rise. It is the same in the high efficiency PV cell segment. Most PV cell makers have no products in stock so the spot price has reached around RMB 1.65 per watt. Emergent orders were mostly booked by prices that were RMB 0.02~0.04 per watt higher than usual orders, which helped increase level of PV cells’ spot price.
During this week, price trend of mono-si PV cells, which was limited in supply, slightly increase. On the contrary, prices of high-efficiency products such as mono-si and multi-si PERC cells significantly increased by approximately US$ 5 cents per watt thanks to advantageous efficiency and supply shortage.
PV module’s price this week remained at a similar level with in last week. Nonetheless, after China’s installation rush ends, it is necessary for the PV industry to focus on whether U.S.’s Section 201 will stimulate another phase of market demand for hedge against possible trade barrier. This opportunity is especially crucial for third-party countries’ production capacity, which were originally established to fulfill the U.S. market. The Section 201 and demand for preventive hedge could further raise PV module’s price.

PV product supply for China’s installation rush ahead of June 30 will be ended in next one to two weeks, so PV capacity have been almost booked. With only a few stock volume for supply, PV makers increased their quotes for products, while turnover volume at peak price was very small.
Polysilicon sector firstly took the strain of the end of demand for China’s June-30 installation rush across the PV value chain. Furthermore, EnergyTrend forecasts a large amount of additional capacity for polysilicon during this year, which will worsen polysilicon’s over supply although polysilicon makers have scheduled annual maintenance in off seasons. Consequently, the quote and spot price this week have stuck at RMB 116 per kg, representing a cooling-down of the price’s rising trend. Quotes for next week may decrease due to expectation of order reduction starting from June.
On the contrary, si-wafer was still short in supply. On one hand, wafer vendors have insufficient product for sell so turnover was low and price went upwards. On the other hand, market vision is positive so makers treasures their production capacity in late June and increase quote of si-wafers. This week, China-made high efficiency multi-si wafers’ price has reached RMB 4.7 per piece, while Taiwan-made ones’ has surpassed US$9.62 per piece. In addition, China-made wafers will majorly be delivered to domestic market until mid-June because of supply shortage caused by installation rush by June 30. Overseas shipment has been slashed in the short-term.
Mono-si wafer’s volume and price both remained the same with last week. There was no stock for purchase, and the price was still at US$0.81~0.82 per piece, which was led by a leading company. However, EnergyTrend expects that mono-si wafer manufacturers will start reduce their quotes in late June so that they can maintain a reasonable and competitive price gap with multi-si wafers. This price gap will also be designed with newly added mono-si wafer production capacity and severer competitive with multi-si products for the next phase “Top Runner Program.”
Price of PV cells remained relatively stable this week. Because products in May have already been fully booked, only a few manufacturers slightly increased their quotes. However, prices of high efficiency PV cells, such as multi-si cells with 18.8% conversion efficiency and mono-si PERC with 21% and above efficiency, were reported to be raised more significantly because of supply shortage and strong, continuous demand.
PV module price rose in a moderate step. Market demand to PV modules has been relatively strong thanks to the installation rush by June 30, yet the market expects demand to cool down after the deadline, bringing a sign of supply shortage and a potential trend of price rise.

China’s June-30 deadline is around the corner, driving PV prices across the value chain to rise during this week. Si-wafer’s and PV cell’s prices rose, while polysilicon’s and PV module’s prices remained nearly the same with last week. Different supply-demand bottlenecks and strategies among different sectors caused this situation. Besides, RMB currency appreciated against US dollar so the US-dollar average quotes were slightly increased.
Polysilicon sector
Price of polysilicon remained almost the same with last week. Nonetheless, polysilicon makers will try to raise price as a test on next week’s market quotes since si-wafer sector, the direct downstream to polysilicon, has enjoyed peaked price and high order visibility.
Polysilicon sector has encountered oversupply and competition brought by newly released production capacity, hence the makers are reinforced to be conservative with price rise, in case of losing orders. If high order visibility in the downstream sectors continues, si-wafer makers could accept rose price to secure material sources and polysilicon’s price may be rose.
Si-wafer sector
Market demand and price trend of si-wafers continued being strong like in last week. In high efficiency wafer segment, especially, the order visibility has extended after China’s June 30 deadline through late-June to early-July. This situation encourages wafer makers as well as stimulates wafer quote’s upward trend.
This week, China-made ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer’s price has reached RMB 4.75~4.8 per piece. Taiwan-made ones’ price remained almost the same with last week due to no volume for sale. On the other hand, mono-si wafer’s price stuck at the same level with last week.
PV cell sector
Price fluctuation in the PV cell sector was stronger than in other sectors. Because of the upcoming installation deadline, PV cell makers’ quotes were chaotic. The quote has reached RMB 1.8 per watt, while the final price also rose to RMB 1.75~1.78 per watt.
Urgent module orders are more profitable, so cell purchasers who have secured urgent module orders are capable of accepting the hiking cell price. However, such a strong price trend can only last to mid-June. Both cell sector’s upstream and downstream sectors, wafers and modules, will enjoy short-term business advantages after June 30, therefore, they would put pressure on PV cell manufacturers.
PV module sector
Strong demand driven by China’s June-30 deadline and Indian market covers most module supply, giving PV module makers opportunity to raise their price. However, since the market vision is not clear by now, module manufacturers tend to maintain good relationships with their clients instead of rising the price. As a result, only few orders were dealt at a higher price level this week.

PV cell was the only sector across the PV value chain that witnessed significant price rise this week, while other sectors’ rise rates were relatively small. Nonetheless, PV prices across the value chain were still strong due to factors including RMB currency appreciation, supply shortage in the third-party countries, and market differentiation between Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers.
A new situation emerged among China’s installation rush ahead of June 30, a deadline that significantly influences the PV price trend. EnergyTrend found that many Chinese PV developers have appealed to government for postponement of the installation deadline. Their appeal, which has yet been approved, was resulted from issues that delay installing. The issues mainly include land measuring, supply agreement repudiation, and unexpected peaking price offered by EPC service suppliers.
Some PV project developers already decided to decelerate installing, turning to wait for government’s answer. They evaluated that it is risky to compensate on-time installation for squeezed profit brought by products or EPC service suppliers’ unreasonable price ahead of the June-30 deadline. Furthermore, it is unsure if the developers could complete project construction by June 30 even they do pay for products and EPC services. Consequently, these developers chose to wait for government’s answer to their appeal instead of being urgent to install PV projects, and hence helped extend PV demand through July.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon quote continued rising this week, while the rise scale was not large because orders for June have nearly been full-booked and orders requested for July are still few. Likewise, polysilicon trading price has grown but slightly. The average selling price for polysilicon remained at RMB 116 per kg, and for high-quality polysilicon reached RMB 120 per kg.
Si-wafers
Consecutive supply shortage in si-wafer sector helped boost wafer price to hike, but the volume was very limited. This week, Taiwan-made ultra-high-efficiency wafer price stuck at US$0.625 per piece, while China-made price increased slightly to RMB 4.77~4.82 per piece. Besides, RMB currency appreciation against US dollar drove a more significant price rise regarding orders dealt with US dollar currency.
PV cells
PV cell’s price continued rising this week. In China, PV cell’s quote has already reached RMB 1.85 per watt, yet only few volume can be traded before June 30. Meanwhile, PV cell price in Taiwan also grew. PV cells with 18.4% efficiency has been traded at price of up to US$0.225 per watt.
Taiwan PV cell makers have been trying to ship products at peak prices in recent two weeks because they are unsure about order and price after mid-June. However, several factors will help sustain their utilization rates. First, USA’s Section 201 will trigger extra demand, and PV cell makers in third-party countries would prefer shipping products to the U.S. market, squeezing supply to the European market. Second, the European market enters into peak season in the third quarter. Third, SolarWolrd’s bankruptcy reduced the German giant’s production capacity, which will worsen the expected supply shortage in the European market in the upcoming quarter. Taiwan-made PV cells, therefore, can fulfill the supply void in Europe through July.
PV modules
PV modules available for shipping by next week are so few that their price has been peaking and peaking. EnergyTrend even found multi-si, 270W module order traded at RMB 3.05 per watt. However, the supply shortage and very little volume restricted the price’s upward trend. As a result, PV module’s average selling price rose moderately this week. On the other hand, the moderate price rise of PV module products also represented fluctuation in currency exchange rate.
As mentioned above, PV market demand could be extended after June 30 so order outlook toward July is overall positive. Nonetheless, most PV module manufacturers are conservative in module price trend after late-June. They rather believe that a new phase of price adjustment would follow current supply shortage.

Installation rush in China ahead of June 30 is about to terminate, so trading volume has significantly dropped. For one thing, there is nearly no product for transaction in the market; for the other, it is meaningless to buy PV products this week because it is impossible to complete construction and grid connection on time. In China, both upstream and downstream PV sectors possess a “wait-and-see” attitude toward future market, leaving PV spot prices nearly unchanged this week.
U.S.’s Section 201 will make the U.S. market the successor to China market’s leading position in terms of global demand. Due to U.S. PV developers’ psychological expectations, the U.S. market demand is surging. Global PV supply shortage has gradually shifted to so-called “third-party” countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, where are not covered under U.S.’s anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs. U.S. market’s PV demand will emerge forwards to the third quarter of 2017, and PV suppliers will choose to fulfill orders earlier in the same quarter to avoid future supply risks. These factors will essentially stimulate utilization rates in third-party countries.
Furthermore, SolarWorld AG, the former leader of the European PV industry, has filed bankruptcy and hence severely hinders European market’s local supply. As the European market usually enters into peak seasons in the second and third quarter, PV demand at peak seasons has becoming stronger this year. Third-party countries’ capacity in, at least, the next two months, therefore, has already been booked, thanks to stronger demand in the U.S. and the European markets.
This phase of strong demand will be mainly driven by USA and Europe, markets that have respectively set certain trade barriers against China and Taiwan. Since Taiwan-made PV cells have won exemption from EU’s anti-circumvention duties, European market would favor Taiwanese products rather than Chinese products, which will again create different price trends to PV manufacturers basing across the Taiwan Strait.
In China, market uncertainty after June 30 has fluctuated PV prices, while it is contrary to the market outlook in Taiwan. This week, prices of Taiwan-made si-wafers and PV cells both continued growing led by price rise of third-party countries’ production. Especially, the spot price of ultra-high efficiency multi-si wafer, a segment that has been stock at severe supply shortage, has reached US$0.63~0.64 per piece. Ultra-high efficiency multi-si PV cell’s spot price has been rose to US$0.23 per watt.
As for mono-si PV products, leading company LONGi has announced to cut its product prices to shorten the price gap between mono-si and multi-si products in case of losing customers, despite that the market demand to mono-si products remains strong.
Demand differentiation created by the U.S. and European markets goes to PV module sector as well. PV module supply from the third-party country capacity has been in short. The order visibility extends by more than two months and the module quotes are also hiking. Suniva requested unreasonable high tariffs for PV cell and module imports, so U.S. purchasers will accept PV products at even higher price level. As a result, EnergyTrend expects that the PV price trend, especially in the U.S. and European market, will keep rising as it closes to the end of the third quarter.

The postponement of some grid-connection plans, originally scheduled on June 30, on the Chinese market has pushed back the demand for PV cells and modules to July, stabilizing prices at various sectors of the PV supply chain this week, which may begin to tumble in the second half of July, as there will be only demand related to the ""Top Runner Program"" and "" distributed PV generation systems left in China after July and demand in India will also slacken in August.
Meanwhile, PV prices in Taiwan and Southeast Asia, however, have kept on hiking, jacking up end-demand prices in the U.S. and Europe. In sharp contrast to the uncertain business outlook for Chinese firms in Q3, U.S. demand is expected to strengthen further, thanks to the continuing concern about Section 201, extension of third-party countries’ high capacity utilization rate to August and beyond, and the approaching of U.S. ITC’s final ruling in September.
Price trend 
Polysilicon prices have stabilized in the range of RMB 115-120/kg this week. Chinese firms expect polysilicon prices to remain stable, possibly with a slight decline, in July, a trend which will continue subsequently. EnergyTrend also believes that price decline, if any, will be limited.
Wafer prices have begun to diverge among different regions. Prices in Taiwan and other places, except China, will trend upward on robust demand, bolstering end-demand prices. Clouded by blurry market outlook, China's domestic prices, still stable now, are more likely to drop.
Prices of PV cells and modules are experiencing a similar trend. Affected by anti-dumping and countervailing duties, U.S. demand has emerged, ahead of schedule, overstraining the capacities of Taiwan and third-party countries and jacking up prices rapidly. Taiwan's PV cell price, quite stable this week, will be driven to go up next week.
As for mono-si supply chain, LONGi, a major mono-si wafer supplier, cut its mono-si wafer price by US$0.02 last week, to US$0.78-0.80 per wafer, prompting rivals and companies in the downstream value chain to lower prices, as well.

Indigenous PV demand, along with downstream demand, in China will be extended to July, as completion date for many PV projects, unable to meet the original schedule for grid connection on June 30, has been extended by one month, on the approval of municipal governments or arrangement by investors themselves. Meanwhile, robust demand induced by article 201 in the U.S. will continue, helping, directly or indirectly, prices of PV industrial chain in Taiwan and third places to stay high.
EnergyTrend predicts that should prices of PV supply chain soar, demand of U.S. customers will drop, putting a damper on price hike of third-place products. However, overshadowed by the uncertainty of ITC ruling, which is approaching, prices will linger at high level, unless some U.S. customers abandon PV power station projects, slashing demand.
Most PV prices have remained flat this week, except wafer prices which rise further. However, with June 30 schedule-induced boom coming to an end and demand slackening, upstream and downstream players are being engaged in a tumultuous psychological gambling underneath a seemingly stable market.
Polysilicon 
With downstream wafer prices set to go higher, polysilicon prices have fluctuated somewhat this week, but polysilicon supply has remained sufficient, making price hike unlikely, as downstream market is expected to weaken. Its price is expected to drop, in step with the trend for the industrial chain.
Wafer 
Wafer prices have risen this week, bucking the industrial trend, due to strained supply which has lasted two months. GCL-Poly, industry champion boasting 20% global share, has raised multi-si wafer prices this week, prompting other major suppliers to follow suit.
Prices have been driven upward, due to continuing projects after the June 30 schedule and strong demand from third-place players who are running at full capacity. The June 30 deferred demand is expected to let up in the second half of July, driving down multi-si wafer prices and relieving downstream players from excessively high cost. With less June 30 deferred demand and items of ""Top Runner Program"" having yet to start construction, demand for mono-si wafers has dropped, which may prompt leading mono-si wafer suppliers to cut prices further, in order to stimulate demand and boost market shares.
PV Cell 
Trend for PV cells diverges among different production sites this week. Backed by indigenous demand, Chinese suppliers disregard price-cut request by downstream module firms but are expected to stay put for another week at most before facing real pressure from the demand side. Given wafer price hike and continuing strong demand, Taiwan and third-place suppliers have raised their prices further, but the price hike has slackened, on the request of U.S. customers.
Module
Bolstered by June 30 deferred demand, module prices have remained stable but are expected to weaken in the first half of July, given market consensus on demand decline in the second half of the month.

                                Demand Wasn't Frozen after June 30 but Outlook is Hugely Uncertain: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170706-11847.html,"









After China’s installation rush by June 30th was over, PV supply chain price and demand didn't sharply drop as expected, but even slightly moved up. Thus, PV manufacturers' opinion toward upcoming price direction varied from one another.
Based on EnergyTrend's survey, this week all segments of supply chain's final prices mostly stayed stable. Exceptions were the following: Overseas products showed mild price uptrend. Average mono-si demand dropped, so its prices fell slightly.  As for the outlook, si wafer will be in short supply. Orders have booked entire month's production. Thus, si wafer's price rise is definite. Regarding the rest of segments, in particular the downstream, price quotations showed a mix of up and down. Expectation from all sides differ from each other a lot.
Polysilicon
With respect to polysilicon, downstream si wafer orders have accumulated to a future duration, so its price rose. During this week, the amount of multi-si firms in China who increased price quotations grew. However, merely some buyers accept the slightly rising prices for the following reasons: International multi-si prices did not change, and the market demand has not reached the intensified status.
EnergyTrend expected, for now the downstream PV market in mainland China has not accumulated many orders to further future. Si wafer enterprises do receive international demand. Nonetheless, as local demand from mainland China dropped, si wafer orders' growth rate is slowing down. Multi-si price will begin to fall due to si wafer manufacturers' request. This price drop is expected to take place between mid-July and early August.
Si wafer
Si wafer has still been a strong segment in terms of demand this week. Its prices did not change much. However, most of company orders have booked to the end of July. This has been the best demand among all segments. Si wafer manufacturers' capacity utilization rates are maintained at peak. Thus, si wafer manufacturers will gain greater voice this month. In other words, downstream PV cell manufacturers' price negotiation power will be weakened this month.
Si wafer price in Taiwan mildly rose this week mainly because individual manufacturers raised price later than it should have for ultra-high-efficiency si wafer. When multi-si and mono-si wafer are compared, mono-si wafer price peaked and demand remained sluggish in the short run. Mono-si wafer demand is expected to grow due to the Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 in USA and Top Runner Program in China. However, mono-si wafer manufacturers would prevent the price gap between mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer from expanding too much, and prevent mono-si wafer market share from shrinking. Therefore, atmosphere to lower mono-si wafer price is still strong.
PV cells
This week PV cell price stayed constant, but its future direction is to be carefully watched. The PV cell demand in markets outside of China and Taiwan stayed strong. However, PV cell price reached the ceiling that downstream module houses could accept. Currently, Taiwan manufacturers' PV cell price has exceeded above US $0.235/W. As to the markets (outside of China and Taiwan), price can hit US $0.245/W. As to the mainstream price of PV cells in mainland China, they were generally above RMB 1.8~1.83/W. With respect to mono-si PV cells, this week the downstream demand turned weak. Hence, most module houses' factory schedules have centered on multi-si PV cells for delayed fulfillment from Chinese orders by June 30th. Accordingly, mono-si PV cell price dropped mildly.
Modules
This week, module price slightly rose in markets other than China and Taiwan. The price rise speed apparently slowed down. Before further news of the Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 in the USA breaks, price is expected not to rise again. As to mainland China, tier-one manufacturers' module production schedules are booked to the end of July. However, China's domestic demand is expected to become weak during the last 10 days of July, so its price would mostly maintain stable.

During the second week of July, market demand basically repeated its status from last week. Some delayed fulfillment from Chinese orders by June 30th still existed. Multi-si supply chain's demand remained high. Current utilization rates can last to the second half of July. However, orders of August remain uncertain.
Because of mono-si products' lukewarm demand, PV cell manufacturers hoped the upstream manufacturers would drop their prices. Nonetheless, from mono-si wafer manufacturers' perspectives, they intend to maintain its price drop at a certain pace, and international demand is enough to sustain some quantity of sales. Thus, the pace of the price’s fall is not as fast as PV cell manufacturers would have wanted.
Regarding global module capacity, module capacities of Southeast Asian countries (other than Taiwan or China) such as Vietnam, Thailand or Malaysia are not enough to fulfill the demand from Europe and US markets in 3Q17. Overly high prices forced orders to transfer to other nations' module houses, such as India, Turkey or even Europe. As a result, demand toward Taiwanese PV cells further expanded.
Polysilicon
In the past week, polysilicon prices stayed flat. Some manufacturers expressed that the inventory level has been low and there has been no extra inventory for selling, but they have also been concerned about the market demand during the second half of July, so they will refrain from suddenly raising prices.
This week mainland China's polysilicon final prices mainly came to RMB 118~123/kg. There are more manufacturers scheduling for annual maintenance in 3Q17. Thus, from polysilicon manufacturers' point of views, even if manufacturers are uncertain about market outlook, at least prices in 3Q17 will not collapse.
Si wafer
Si wafer's production schedules are still being booked, and this segment has been the only one whose strong demand lasts to August. Due to demand of Taiwanese manufacturers and of markets other than Taiwan or China, some international ultra-high-efficiency multi-si wafer prices kept on moving up. Their order price can be 1~2 cents higher per piece in August than in July.
Moreover, mono-si wafer's end-market demand is not enough, so PV cell prices began to be less steady. Mono-si wafer foundries were asked to drop prices. However, regions outside of Taiwan and China showed strong demand. As for mono-si wafer segment, there are currently not a lot of concerns about sales for now. Hence, foundries did not immediately agree with the downstream customers' requests to lower prices. Rather, based on investment plans and capacity expansion strategies, foundries steadily lead the pace of lowering prices. Prices of this week remained flat.
PV cells
Mono-si PV cells' prices began to weaken this week due to the pressure of sluggish demand. Some mainland China's manufacturers lowered their prices by RMB 0.01~0.02/W.
Multi-si PV cell demand was maintained. Production lines are booked to the second half of July. Nonetheless, PV cell manufacturers are still very carefully observing how market demand in August will go. They hope to only provide quote prices after the market outlook is definite.
With respect to Taiwanese PV cell manufacturers, production lines are highly booked by orders in July, and the outlook of demand quantities or quote prices will be both optimistic in August.
Modules
Module prices did not fluctuate hugely this week. However, the market highly anticipated for price drop, and module houses also expected mainland China demand to fall. Accordingly, orders' prices in August have apparently moved down.

As of mid-July, downstream mono-si demands had remained sluggish for three weeks consecutively. Mono-si PV cell suppliers began to cut prices at larger scale this week, driving downward mono-si wafer prices, a development conducive to higher mono-si market share. Meanwhile, with price-hike momentum for multi-si wafers amid overstrained supply remaining high, market attention is on the pricing strategy of suppliers. Should they decide to raise prices, PV cell quotes will follow, narrowing the price gap with mono-si products. Prices in other sectors will mostly remain flat or rise slightly.
Polysilicon 
With inventories remaining tight as last week, lots of capacities are scheduled for annual maintenance in Q3, as the market has began to slacken in the wake of June 30 installation rush. Should strained inventories continue, concentration of orders may step up, driving up polysilicon prices. With polysilicon prices stabilizing at RMB 118-123/kg this week, suppliers have become increasingly bullish, as chance for acceptance of price hike by the downstream sector has become higher.
Si-Wafer
Major mono-si wafer supplier Zhonghuan Solar cut prices by 2.5% this week, driving down 190mm mono-si wafer price to RMB 5.9/pc, which has prompted downstream PV-cell suppliers to follow suit. Other smaller suppliers are expected to lower prices later on.
Utilization rates of capacity of leading multi-si wafer suppliers are still overstrained by demands, notably overseas demands, mostly for high-performance products, in the United States and Europe, which remained high. Prices of ultra high-performance multi-si wafers stayed at RMB 5-5.05/pc and further hike for overseas prices, which will drive up prices of Taiwan-made PV cells, cannot be ruled out.
PV Cell
Mono-si PV cell prices continued to drop, at larger scale, this week, with prices of China-made PV cells having decreased to RMB 1.88-1.9/W, although prices of Taiwan-made PV cells remained stable, thanks to overseas demands which stayed high. Cross-Strait quotes for multi-si PV cells have been stable this week, but price performance of the two sides may diverge in August, as difference in their end-market demands becomes evident.
Module
Amid a general stable status this week, module prices between first- and second-tier suppliers diverged further, as demands this month concentrated on large-scale projects. Multi-si module prices of first-tier Chinese suppliers stayed at RMB 2.85-2.95/W, compared with RMB 2.65-2.75/W for second-tier suppliers. Given extension of orders for first-tier suppliers to early August, price stabilization for overall supply chain will be postponed by one to two weeks.

With China's downstream demand beginning to weaken this week, capacity utilization rate of first-tier module firms has remained relatively high, thanks to delivery of remaining orders for PV projects yet to be installed after the June 30 deadline and more concentrated overseas demands. Prices, however, have begun to shake, overshadowing price performance in the upstream sector, although overseas demands remain strong, driving up prices further.
Polysilicon 
Polysilicon prices have begun to rise this week, thanks to continuing demand from downstream wafer and reduced supply, caused by annual maintenance of major polysilicon firms. Prices on the mainland Chinese market stand at RMB 121-126/kg this week, which are expected to be even higher next week, with ceiling targeted at RMB 128-130/kg.
Si-Wafer
With mainland China's downstream demand in August remaining uncertain, multi-si wafer prices have remained flat this week, while supply of multi-si wafers in other markets has continued to be overstrained by demand, with orders having been extended to the second half of August. Overseas quotes for ultra high-efficiency multi-si wafers have risen further to US$0.66-0.7/pc.
Prices of mono-si wafers have remained flat, in the range of 0.787-0.83/pc, this week. Overstrained supply of Taiwanese mono-si wafer plants has been alleviated, thanks to the gradual initiation of new capacities and declining demand in mainland China. Prices will be even higher in the next two weeks, given certainty for further price hike for polysilicon and strong overseas downstream demand.
PV cell
Situation of PV cell has remained virtually unchanged this week. With downstream major suppliers still having ample overseas orders in hand, spot prices have been kept, while prices of non China-made PV cells have continued to rise slightly but the prices have approached the level bearable for downstream customers. In August, PV-cell suppliers will have a tough time in price negotiation, due to downward extension of price hike for upstream polysilicon and capping of downstream module prices.
Module 
Module prices and demands have diverged further, as first-tier module firms have maintained their capacity utilization rate at rather high level, thanks to concentration of overseas orders, albeit at slightly lower prices, in sharp contrast to steeper price drop of small and medium suppliers focusing on China's domestic market.

                                Wafer Prices Surge on Shortfall of Polysilicon: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170803-11897.html,"









Due to eruption of shortfall in supply of polysilicon, triggered by annual maintenance of Chinese capacities and unexpected production cut, scramble for supply has appeared on the spot market this week, further jacking up prices of multi-si wafer, which is already in strained supply. Weighed down by the pressure from upstream materials, Chinese and Taiwanese PV cell suppliers differ in price hikes, as a result of their price-negotiation leverage and divergent needs of their respective markets.
Polysilicon 
Still overshadowed by the demand and price crash in Q3 last year, most major polysilicon suppliers have arranged annual maintenance in Q3, to cope with slackening market in the wake of the June 30 deadline. Before the maintenance sets in at large scale, polysilicon inventory has remained low, as wafer demand by overseas PV-cell suppliers has stayed high, an effect of U.S.’s Section 201, plus deferred Chinese demands and limited new polysilicon capacities.
As of the third week of July, polysilicon supply remained tight, prompting some suppliers to consider price hike. The successive inauguration of capacity maintenance, which had cut market supply by 10%, triggered a round of price hike last week, due to continuing strong demands from downstream wafer suppliers. The unexpected disruption of Chinese polysilicon capacities this week is expected to reduce Chinese polysilicon output by 20-25% for at least two weeks. In order to honor supply contracts, downstream polysilicon suppliers have begun to purchase spot goods massively on domestic and overseas markets, leading to steep spot price hike, to RMB130-135/kg in China and US$16/kg abroad.
Si-Wafer 
Affected by polysilicon shortfall, multi-si wafer supply has also been overstrained by demand, reinforcing suppliers to not only cut contract supply to PV-cell firms but also hike prices sharply to restrict urgent orders. As a result, prices of ultra high-efficiency multi-si wafers have shot up to RMB 5.15/pc and US$0.67/pc this week.
PV cell 
Caught between high wafer prices, due to overstrained supply, and declining module demand, PV cell suppliers are having a difficult time to have downstream module firms accept their price hike. Bolstered by demands from Europe and the U.S., Taiwanese PV-cell suppliers have more leverage for the price hike but in general concession from module firms will be limited, before upturn of module prices.
Mono-si PV cell suppliers have suffered price drop this week due to sluggish demands, but the effect has been alleviated by previous price cut of mono-si wafers. Despite dumping prices for some transactions, price decline of mono-si PERC PV cells has also been moderate this week, with mainstream price staying at RMB2.3-2.5/w.
Module
With suppliers striving to defend their prices, transactions for mono-si 280W modules have been made at RMB 3-3.02/W this week but price drop may be moderated soon, due to the effect of the shortfall of multi-si modules. With domestic demands having begun to slacken, prices of China-made multi-si modules have begun to weaken slightly, with mainstream prices ranging RMB 2.83-2.87/W. Prices of third-party countries’ modules, however, have stayed high, at US$0.38/W, thanks to antidumping and countervailing duties and the effect of the Section 201.

                                Polysilicon Continues to Be in Short Supply Which Leads to Unstable Prices in the Supply Chain: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170810-11909.html,"









Shortfall in supply of polysilicon has remained this week, which results in the surging price and causes great effect to the industrial supply chain due to the uncertainty of raw material’s quantity and price. Compared with downstream supply chain, wafer still has the bargaining advantage. Therefore, the rising cost of polysilicon can be shifted downward. However, the condition of PV cell doesn’t look that well. Because of low demand of China and modules’ inability to accept rising price, most manufacturers are reluctant about accepting the rising prices of PV cell suppliers. Only first-tier manufacturers are able to handle the slight price hikes with the support of America’s high amount of orders. Besides, since Taiwan’s PV-cell firms can fulfill the US and European markets’ demand with zero or lower tax rate, the range for raising price is bigger than that in China.
Polysilicon 
Polysilicon price has kept surging this week. Because shortfall ofpolysilicon occurs when the condition of supply and demand is tight and the unexpected event happens, it can be difficult for full order downstream wafer suppliers to handle. They need to purchase spot goods in high price, which results in much higher prices of polysilicon. There are even customers who purchased America’s polysilicon with high anti-dumping duty. Spot good price in China has already reached RMB 140-145/kg, and is still going up, leading to the rise of polysilicon price in Korea and in America. The price is currently between US$13.4-16.4/kg.
Si-Wafer
Under the impact of price hike of polysilicon price, multi-si wafer’s spot price increased to the next level as well. However, because of last month’s contract price, si-wafer firms are still expected to be impacted by the highly unstable prices and supply of polysilicon.
Prices of ultra high-performance multi-si wafers have been in a state of chaos this week. Due to the instability of the cost, many firms in China are unwilling to provide quoted prices. The range of mainstream price is RMB 5.15-5.3/pc, while the international price is US$ 0.68-0.7/pc. As to mono-si wafer, the shortfall of multi-si wafer has already led to a shift in orders for mono-si wafer, and the price gap between them is nearly approaching RMB0.6/pc. However, the quantity still isn’t enough to support the capacity, and it remains narrowly stable.
PV Cells
Because some Chinese and Taiwanese PV cell manufacturers' downstream demand varied this week, PV cell prices were slightly raised up but basically the price trend was stable. Chinese PV cell price reached RMB 1.82~1.84/W and Taiwan's came to US $0.236~0.239/W. From PV cell manufacturers' perspective, as mid-stream companies were at a disadvantage because the upstream of supply chain raised prices and the downstream pressed for lowering prices, some PV cell manufacturers encountered upstream si-wafer supply shortage, and these manufacturers couldn't afford to purchase products with high spot price. Therefore, they had to temporarily shut down some production lines.
Modules
The PV module demand in the domestic market of China was not urgent, so PV module companies took more effort to maintain stable prices and prevent prices from falling. In contrast, PV module prices outside of China region will have the potential to grow because the US market demand will enter a period of peak demand. Regarding to the US market, initial investigation result of the Section 201 petition will be officially announced on September 22. PV industry believes that they must finish the custom entry for PV modules before the date above, in order to avoid possible risks. If duration of maritime shipping is added to the equation, the end of August will be the final due date. As a result, end-market prices are expected to ramp up, and tier-one module factories in China will increase their utilization rates.

                                Shortfall in Supply of Polysilicon has Improved Slightly While Middle and Downstream Prices Still Suffer Squeezes: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170817-11917.html,"










	There are many polysilicon plants being overhauled in August and September. Also, the demand of si-wafer in August is still high. Therefore, although the tough condition of supply in polysilicon has improved slightly, the obvious drop in price can’t be seen in the short term. On the other hand, canceling orders and shortening capacity have started occurring in the downstream market in China and resulted in the decline in price; under the condition of different up and downstream price trends, the middle and downstream manufacturers have started purchasing lower-level si-wafer in order to maintain profit.
The first demarcation point of demand of the Section 201 petition is in the end of August. After reaching September, the demand from America is expected to decline noticeably. This will in turn lead to the drop of polysilicon price in the supply chain.
Polysilicon 
The overhauling of polysilicon plants will continue until September. In addition, some of the manufacturers will begin to decrease their supplies and prepare their material in advance in order to maintain their downstream si-wafer capacity during the overhauling process. These will deepen the shortfall in supply caused by the overhauling. Under the influence of high demand on the overseas downstream market, polysilicon price this week still has great power. This week, polysilicon’s spot price on the market in China reached RMB 145/kg, while the polysilicon price of Korean manufacturers reached US$ 17/kg.
Si-Wafer
Under the impact of high polysilicon price and shortfall, the supply of si-wafer is under limitation at the same time. Due to the high amount of end market demand from overseas, si-wafer price was just like last week’s. Spot price of ultra high-performance multi-si wafer has increased slightly this week, and the normal price is US$ 0.7-0.71/pc. However, there are a small number of deals which have higher prices. As to mono-si wafer, the price has remained stable. However, because mono-si wafer’s leading manufacturer Longi will spend a week in September upgrading its electronic equipment, the production of nearly 50 million pieces of its mono si wafers will be affected. During the same period, many middle to small mono-si wafer manufacturers will also try to meet the requirements of China’s “Top Runner Program” by the end of September. These will all lead to a potential increase in mono-si wafer prices.
PV cell 
The demand which the Section 201 petition has brought in is still high. Plus, overseas demand of tier-one module factories in China is strong enough. These have allowed the PV cell prices of the big manufacturers to be maintained. However, under the impact of China’s cooling market, small and medium sized manufacturers in China are gradually starting to feel more pressure.
Because the acceptable cost for downstream manufacturers has reached to the top, all PV cell prices this week have remained in the range of RMB 1.83/W and US$ 0.237/W. Under the expectation of the decline for downstream module price, PV cell may face severe competition in controlling prices. On the other hand, although mono-si PERC PV cell price steadilyremained at US$ 0.3-0.33/W, normal mono-si PV-cell price have slightly decreased by RMB 0.01/W to RMB 1.86-1.88/W.
Module
Just like PV cell manufacturers, module manufacturers suffered price squeezes between up and downstream manufacturers. Under the impact of the increase of si-wafer price, upstream PV cell vendors have kept asking for lower prices. At the same time, downstream developing factories are continuing to require module makers to decrease their price because the FIT price is falling. Currently, because the orders of the module makers are coming from the tier-one industries, when facing the PV cell manufacturers, they have a better position in negotiation. Therefore, even if the price declines, they will still gain profits. However, due to the uncertain schedule of China’s demand in the future, module manufacturers will have to accept the downstream request of declining prices sooner or later. It will become the war of controlling prices between module manufacturers and PV cell manufacturers.

                                TrendForce Expects Polysilicon Prices to Remain High in Third Quarter Even Though Supply Might Start to Improve in Mid-September                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170817-11919.html,"

The latest PV market analysis from EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, finds that the average global spot price of polysilicon has surged by 20% between the end of July and the middle of August. The polysilicon supply has tightened up suddenly because the leading supplier in China had to do an emergency repair at one of its factories. This added to the pressure on the supply caused by annual plant maintenance works carried out by other suppliers.
The squeeze on the polysilicon supply will start to loosen in the middle of September, when the U.S. market awaits for the preliminary decision by the U.S. International Commission (ITC) on Suniva’s petition. However, some polysilicon suppliers have plant maintenance tasks scheduled into the third quarter. Therefore, the overall available polysilicon stock will still be quite limited. TrendForce anticipates polysilicon prices to drop again in September, but the average spot price in China is not expected to go under RMB 135 per kilogram.
“This drastic decrease in polysilicon supply is just too great and will have an impact across the PV supply chain,” said EnergyTrend analyst Jason Tsai. “A large portion of the current polysilicon demand that was arranged earlier by the downstream markets will not be met even if polysilicon supplier have released their emergency reserves and buyers scoured the market. Spot prices of multi-Si wafers have also jumped since the shortage of polysilicon limited their supply.”
Furthermore, PV cell suppliers based in Taiwan or have factories in third-party countries are now dealing with an influx of orders, as August is the peak demand period in the U.S. and Europe. To keep up shipments, they will have to bear the polysilicon cost increase that the wafer suppliers have passed on to them in the form higher wafer prices. Small-and medium-size PV cell suppliers in China do not have a lot of orders from foreign markets, so they can lower their capacity utilization rates to moderate the effect of rising polysilicon cost. On the whole, the upstream sections of the PV supply chain are beginning to reap a greater share of the profit margin.

On the demand side, U.S. solar companies have pulled PV module orders ahead so that products will enter the U.S. before the ITC announces its preliminary ruling on Suniva’s petition on September 22. Both module exporters and importers want to minimize the risk of paying cash deposits for duties that may be imposed following the September ruling. Thus, module shipments by sea must leave their departing ports no later than in the latter half of August.
With most deliveries made before September, the effect of Suniva’s petition on the demand across the supply chain will be less significant. Hence, there is a strong chance that demand and prices along the multi-Si product chain will start to fall during September. Prices and demand for mono-Si products on the other hand will be driven by China’s Top Runner Program in the same period. Since the grid-connection deadline for solar projects under the Top Runner Program is September 30, the mono-Si demand is expected to peak in the near term on account of the installation rush. Polysilicon prices will be supported by the tight supply and the demand from the mono-Si market.

This week, after the improvement of shortfall of polysilicon, the supply chain basically remains stable. However, due to the tight supply of polysilicon, the price is still high and made si-wafer price become high at the same time. Nevertheless, the downstream pressure is affecting the supply chain, bringing more pressure of lowering prices to PV cell and module manufacturers. Compared to PV cell manufacturers, part of the tier-one module factories has more abilities to handle the situation when production line stops. Also, the businesses of PV cell manufacturers usually focus on specific module manufacturers. These have made the PV cell manufacturers become the core under the seesaw battle between the upstream and downstream prices this week.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon price is stable this week. The price in China is still RMB 140-145/kg. Even if the quoted price is over RMB 145, their transaction numbers are still very low. In the overseas market, there are higher ranges from Korean manufacturers, but basically the spot price is over US$ 17/kg. Because of the limitation in supply, polysilicon price is expected to remain high until early September. Afterwards, the price may fall slightly due to the limited demand of polysilicon, yet, there will be a lot of demands from the “Top Runner Program” in September, so the decline is expected to be limited.
Si-Wafer
This week, there is basically no purchase of multi-si wafers, so their price remains the same. However, the manufacturers are careful with the quoted price next month. On one hand, it is because of the uncertainty of polysilicon price. On the other hand, they are worried about the downstream demand. Therefore, they are careful with their quoted price strategy. Because polysilicon price has surged, more manufacturers may raise the quoted prices in September by 1-2 cents. As for mono-si wafers, their quoted price is expected to increase by at least 2 cents, as the main supplier will stop producing in September. The small and medium-sized suppliers are expected to have higher increase.

PV cell manufacturers this week suffered the pressure from tier-one module factories in China. They are asked to lower the prices much more. PV cell industries generally can’t take the request to lower prices since si-wafer price is still high. Therefore, their inventory levels have started to go up, which is expected to lead to an increase in sell-off activity in the spot market. At present, the spot price is already at RMB 1.76-1.80/W. However, because there are different pressures from the orders of module manufacturers, the pressures of lowering price that the main PV cell manufacturers suffer this week are not the same. Some of the PV cell manufacturer have not lowered the price this week, and the price remains at RMB 1.83-1.85/W. Based on the fact that the downstream demand of polysilicon is starting to decrease, it is expected that the high price will also start to go down next week.
Module
Mono-si module price in China has fallen to RMB 2.95-2.98/W because of the downstream sector’s decreasing demand. However, because the “Top Runner Program” has made the demand of mono-si increase, and because mono-si wafer price in September has risen, mono-si module price is starting to go up to the original level. As for multi-si module, it is still suffering downstream pressure, and the price is going down at a slow pace on the Chinese market. As the demand of the Section 201 petition slows down, the total average price is expected to decline.

                                PV Cell Sector Suffers More Pressure from Seesaw Battle in the Upstream and Downstream: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170831-11941.html,"









The supply chain of solar energy from this week is similar to that of last week. Upstream prices of polysilicon and si-wafer are high, and they are sold if available. However, downstream prices of PV cell and module are under pressure. Because of the increasing si-wafer price and decreasing PV cell price, the PV cell sector is suffering from the gap. Therefore, it is expected that the utilization rates of PV cell in the next two weeks will decrease.
Polysilicon 
This week, under the impact of the increasing quoted prices from some of the manufacturers, polysilicon price in China has risen to RMB 146-148/kg. Although si-wafer manufacturers are at the final sprint period now, most of the polysilicon manufacturers state that under this price, downstream manufacturers carry heavy burdens placing the orders. Polysilicon price is expected to decrease in the middle of September, just like si-wafer price.
Si-Wafer
Although multi-si wafer price in China hasn’t changed a lot this week, the price in Taiwan has increased above US$ 0.72/pc in September. The main reason for this is the market’s rising polysilicon price. Besides, the supply of si-wafer in Taiwan still has a limitation. Under low supply, the market has no choice but to accept the increase in quoted price.
For mono-si wafer, under the impact of dropping production of the leading manufacturer, which takes up 35% in total supply, the price has increased in the market. One reason that the price went up is that the supply is limited and the market has stocked up beforehand. On the other hand, some PV cell manufacturers switched to producing mono-si PV-cells due to the high prices of multi-si wafer. This caused the demand of mono-si wafer to increase.
PV cell 
PV cell is still the core under the seesaw battle of this price trend. Under the request of tier-one module factories, multi-si PV-cell price has dropped to RMB 1.73-1.78/W, which is close to their request of RMB 1.7/W. Currently, although the PV cell manufacturers which have competitive prices have gained profits under this condition, there is no net income. Therefore, they are starting to find various ways to adjust to the market trend, including shortening their utilization rates, changing multi-si production line into mono-si production line, and adopting low-level multi-si wafer. Multi-si PV-cell price is expected to approach RMB 1.68-1.71/W in the next two weeks. It will have to wait until the middle of September, when the upstream price decreases, for the condition to be improved.
Module
Although there is expectation about the demand of “Top Runner Program” in September, the situation has only started to become clear until this week and it is a little later than expected. The main reason is that there are frame problems in some places which caused the delay of installation. The demand of module needs to be observed and it is possible that some installation may be postponed. Therefore, module price basically hasn’t changed a lot this week.

This week, under the impact of the PV market’s gradually falling demand and increasing material price, the seesaw battle between the upstream and downstream is continuing. The prices in the supply chain is basically constant, with only the mono-si wafer price and multi-si wafer price showing slight changes. However, under the impact of the 2% devaluation of the US dollar, the quoted price in US dollar has increased after the conversion of the product price from RMB. Therefore, all average prices have gone up.
Polysilicon 
Polysilicon price this week still remained at RMB147/kg. Although downstream demand is weak, it is still supportive. Due to future maintenance plan of silicon material plant, polysilicon price is expected to remain above RMB 135/kg while being in short supply in September.
Si-Wafer
Because of the plan of another leading manufacturer to increase its quoted price by RMB 0.05-0.1/pc, the average price of mono-si wafer has remained above USD 0.8/pc. On the contrary, for multi-si wafer, under the influence of the decreasing demand in China, the second-tier manufacturers have started to lower the quoted prices slightly. Owing to current high utilization rates of the downstream module manufacturers, there is a slowdown for the decrease in PV cell price. Also, because upstream polysilicon price is hard to decline, it is expected that si-wafer manufacturers will maintain or just lower the prices slightly. This will result in limited price declines for multi-si wafer in early September. Currently, the price of ultra high-performance multi-si wafer in Taiwan remains at USD 0.72-0.76/pc and the price in China is RMB 5.15-5.2/pc. The price of diamond wire cut multi-si wafer is RMB 4.6-4.7/pc.
PV cell 
Because the downstream module manufacturers have put less pressure on PV cell manufacturers, the orders have become stable now. Most of the PV cell prices are steady, compared with the prices of last week. There is only a little decrease in multi-si PV-cell price in China, and the range has fallen to RMB 1.73-1.75/W. Prices of mono-si PV-cell and Taiwan’s multi-si PV-cell remain at RMB1.84-1.86/W and USD 0.235-0.237/W.
Module
Since the middle of 2017, prices of basic materials in China have surged rapidly. Module manufacturers have suffered the pressure in cost because they applied more materials. Plus, with the downstream demand of decreasing price, the profits for module manufacturers to gain are below 10%. After upstream PV cell’ssuffering of price squeeze late last month, the module section has received a larger space for manipulating the price now. Although the manufacturers plan to increase the prices, they have less chance to succeed. This week, though module prices are different because of the markets and strategies that each manufacturer needs to handle, the prices basically remained stable.

                                Price Trend: Wacker Factory Explosion and Section 201 Clouding PV Supply Chain                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170914-11961.html,"









The explosion at the Wacker chemical plant in Tennessee of the U.S. last week has aggravated the strained polysilicon supply, making the expected price cut by the industrial chain uncertain.
In September, downstream PV-cell module suppliers began to face pressure for price cut, which, plus inventory buildup for polysilicon products following the end of U.S. Section 201-induced demand, prompted price-cut plan spanning entire supply chain. That plan, however, has been clouded by frequent outburst of accidents at upstream polysilicon sector, prolonging strained supply and keeping prices high. Midstream suppliers of PV cells and wafers have the most awkward situation, as their profits have been squeezed by pressure from both the upstream and downstream sectors.
There are a number of noteworthy events next week, including preliminary ruling on Section 201 case, appearance of take-delivery demand before the Oct. 1 long holiday in China, and new trend of the polysilicon market.
Polysilicon
Despite emergent shutdown of Wacker plant's operation following the explosion, most factories have stocked up with materials for September, which, plus China's trade barrier for polysilicon from the U.S., has contained the influence for the time being, before its possible spread one week from now.
As Wacker is a major supplier for Taiwanese wafer manufacturers, Taiwan's polysilicon prices, now at US$17-17.6/kg, are expected to climb starting this or next week, on panic procurement triggered by fear of disrupted supply.
In China, polysilicon prices have stayed at the high level of RMB 147-149/kg this week, with prices of some imported materials topping US$19/kg. With Wacker not a major supplier for Chinese factories, some are willing to import polysilicon from the U.S., despite anti-dumping tariff, due to high polysilicon prices and shortage of supply.  Switch of procurement will tighten polysilicon supply for other brands, inducing China's polysilicon price hike.
With downstream demand on the wane, quite a few polysilicon suppliers are willing to sacrifice some of their large profits and cut prices slightly, for the sake of good customer relationship. In the short term, polysilicon prices will diverge on different customer demands, which, though, won't last long before dissemination of message. Next week will be a critical period for determining market direction.
Wafer
With market demand waning, tight multi-si wafer supply plaguing the market from June through August has been alleviated. With Section 201-induced demands ending in late August, visibility of multi-si wafer orders has been shortened to 0.5-1 months, down from 1.5-2 months in June and July, along with price drop. With polysilicon prices remaining high, first-tier suppliers will only cut prices slightly, in response to downstream pressure, before rendition of preliminary Section 201 ruling and clarification of market trend next week.
Ultra high-performance multi-si wafer prices have dropped slightly to RMB 5.05-5.15/pc this week. Due to cost pressure, downstream demand for diamond wire-sliced multi-si wafers has surged recent two weeks, overstraining supply. Compared with traditional mortar shaping, diamond wire-sliced wafers offer higher margin and are more appealing to customers, prompting expansion.
Due to continuing constraint on supply by leading suppliers on power rationing.    mono-si wafers are simmering for price hike, which, though, has been dampened by multi-si wafer prices, now in the phase of cyclic price decline. Mono-si wafer prices have stayed in the range of RMB 6-6.2/pc or US$0.8-0.84/pc this week, up 0.2% on average.
PV cells
Due to upturn in downstream demand and slackened upstream prices, PV cell prices have been steadier this week. With demand from Southeast Asia and overall polysilicon demand weakening, prices of Taiwan-made PV cells have begun to tumble, narrowing the gap with prices of mainland Chinese products. Given lowering of MIP (minimum import price) for Chinese products by the European Union and end of Section 201-induced demand, advantage of Taiwanese suppliers in the regional market has been reduced. Prices of Taiwan-made PV cells have dipped to US$0.236/W this week, when prices of China-made PV cells have stabled at RMB 1.73-1.75/W. Under price-cut pressure, supply and demand for diamond wire-sliced PV cells have risen.
Module
The module market has remained relatively stable this week. Bolstered by demand related to support for impoverished regions and decentralized policy, China's terminal market features ""unfathomable demand,"" which, plus monopoly of overseas demands by first-tier suppliers, has led to divergent and unstable demands for module suppliers. Recent price hike for supplementary materials has yet to affect module prices. With PV-cell prices remaining stable and popularity of diamond wire-sliced PV cells spreading, it is rather unlikely for module suppliers to pass higher cost for supplementary materials to their prices.

                                Market Adopts Wait and See Attitude Ahead of Section 201 Ruling: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170921-11970.html,"









The shortfall of polysilicon which resulted from the explosion at the Wacker chemical plant in the US has begun. Because the main buyers of the plant come from Taiwan and Southeast Asia, the changes in price has started from these regions. However, since the main polysilicon usage around the world comes from China, its average price has not changed that much.
Except polysilicon, the other markets have remained stable, with manufacturers from each segment taking a wait-and-see attitude. This week, the first ruling on Section 201 case of the US will come out. The result will confirm whether there is protection for the domestic solar cell manufacturing industry in the future. In addition, it will also allow for a better understanding of US ITC’s protectionist policies. Nevertheless, unless the conclusion is clear, the outlook of the market will not become certain until the end of the Oct. 1 long holiday in China. In the following two weeks, the focus will be on short-term stocking. Thus, if the supply can’t meet the demand, it may result in the surge of price.
Polysilicon
Due to the explosion at the Wacker chemical plant in the US, there is a 30% shortage in polysilicon in Taiwan. Although most of the manufacturers have stocks, under the expectation that Wacker is unable to recover in the short-term, each company has been seeking for substitute resources actively since last week. This has caused the spot market’s supplies to temporarily run out this week, resulting in an increase in price. The polysilicon price in China this week remains at RMB 146-148/kg and in Taiwan it is USD 17.8-18.3/kg. Next week, the polysilicon price in China is expected to rise slightly. However, due to the observation period and the focus on demand of distributed system in Q4, there are more loose orders that make it hard to prepare materials by the end of Q3. The increase of polysilicon price is therefore limited.
Si-Wafer
Si-wafer price has hit a plateau this week. Because of the cost advantage of using advanced diamond wire cutting technology, which allows manufacturers to save and consume up to 23% more silicon material, diamond wire cut multi-si wafer has now become the first choice for manufacturers with high polysilicon price in the upstream. At the same time, downstream PV manufacturers’ technique for dealing with diamond wire cut multi-si wafer has matured. The penetration rate has reached 50%. Because the supply is unable to meet the surging demand of downstream in the short-term, the supply remains tight.
In addition to the one-week power rationing in September for mono-si wafer leading manufacturers, the Oct. 1 long holiday will lead to a decrease of 9% in mono-si wafer supply of September and October. However, because the price had already been adjusted two weeks ago, it is expected to remain steady unless temporary demand occurs.
PV cell
This week, PV cell price remains steady as well. Under the trend that the application rates of multi-crystalline black silicon and diamond wire cut PV cell is increasing, the average PV cell price is falling owing to the demand of reducing price in the downstream. Multi-si PV-cell price this week is RMB 1.73-1.75/W and diamond wire cut multi-si PV-cell price is RMB 1.68-1.7/W.
Module
There is stability in the module segment this week. Driven by rumors of the reduction in profit and subsidy, the demand of distributed system in China has kept rising. The other overseas markets are sluggish, except Turkey that has steady demand due to its policy. Besides, for Indian market, although there are only few orders in Q3 because of the high price for module, with the applications of diamond wire cut product, the demand in India has made a breakthrough. It is expected that the demand in the Indian market will improve slightly next month. Overall, under the estimation that the demand of distributed system in China may surge dramatically, multi-si module price will remain weak, at RMB2.75-2.8/W.

                                The First Ruling on Section 201 Case Released, PV Cell Price Becomes Unstable this Week: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20170928-11981.html,"









The first ruling on Section 201 case came out last week, and besides the loss, there isn’t any concrete result, making the changes in the cross-strait supply chains limited. Downstream demand continues to remain weak.
Polysilicon
Due to the accident and overhaul of Chinese and US polysilicon plants, it is roughly estimated that the capacity has decreased 25%-30% and that the supply is still short. However, since the downstream demand has declined at the same time, a large demand-supply gap may not appear.
Currently, the demand-supply gaps of polysilicon mainly appear in individual plants. Because the supply of polysilicon mostly comes from the plants which are under supply restrictions presently, buyers of these manufacturers have to seek the sources of polysilicon in the short-term, making part of the price go up. Overall, the price on the market remains RMB 147-149/kg, only with single increases.
Si-Wafer
The replacement of demand in diamond wire cut multi-si waferfor multi-si wafer has become obvious, putting traditional slurry wire cutting technology in a weak position. In terms of the current supply chain, where upstream price surges and downstream price drops, diamond wire cutting, which can save production cost, has quickly become the mainstream. Nevertheless, the capacity can’t meet the demand temporarily, causing diamond wire cut multi-si wafer to be in short supply. On the contrary, owing to the insufficiency of profit for traditional slurry wire cutting and the operating pressure of si-wafer and battery plants, it has become the first option to be abandoned when the demand goes down.
The mainstream price for diamond wire cut multi-si wafer now is RMB 4.7-4.75/pc; although the change of ultra high-performance multi-si wafer price is smaller, it has remained at around RMB 5.1/pc. The rapid drop of high price which results from short supply this week shows the disadvantage of traditional slurry wire cutting.
Mono-si wafer price has slightly remained flat this week. Due to the alienation by oversea demand at the beginning of Q3 and the delayed progress of “Top Runner Program” by the end of September, plus the power rationing of the leading manufacturers, mono-si wafer price has increased. Yet, during the time when diamond wire cutting is growing rapidly, mono-si wafer plants won’t increase their prices rashly.
PV cell
PV cell price isn’t stable this week. After the decrease of MIP, high performance product price has started to be cut down by clients and cross-strait PERC products has come to a new stage of competition. In the future, if the US adopts higher trade barrier, it seems that the competition of high performance product will become more intense and the speed of price decline will beyond expectation.
Though the mainstream prices of general products remain the same, there are manufacturers planning to raise the prices to deal with the high cost in silicon material. Now they are still observing the acceptance from downstream. However, under the pressure of downstream price, only diamond wire cut PV cell can be accepted successfully. There are difficulties for traditional slurry wire cut PV cell to increase the price. Currently, diamond wire cut PV cell price is RMB 1.71/W and there are still spaces for rising.
Module
Because the first ruling on Section 201 case just confirms the loss as expected, downstream market hasn’t changed much this week. Canada and Singapore may be safe, making the possibility that later prices on the US market will be lower than expected. The drive for manufacturers to sell for the US is limited. Currently, only the third manufacturer which planned to sell for the US before the middle of October still produces as scheduled. China doesn’t ship to other places under the consideration of risks. There isn’t any growth in the prices on the supply chain.
On the other hand, China is weak in pulling in, affecting the downstream price in October. The improvement of polysilicon’s shortfall from upstream may greatly influence the supply chain prices in Q4, making it possible for the bidding projects from last year and 1H17 to be promoted. The focus of Chinese market is on the time when distributed system FIT goes down.

Owing to the Oct. 1 long holiday in China and the Mid-Autumn Festival and Double Ten Day long weekend holiday in Taiwan in this week and next week, over 70% of the solar industry’s supply chains have come to the halt, with no apparent changes in prices.
In terms of the situation of international trade, the public hearing of remedies for Section 201 case of the US was held on October 3. The participants included representatives from China, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan, local official representatives of councilors, and representatives of both supporters and protestors. However, because ITC didn’t clarify their position on the public hearing, and because each participant had only briefly stated their situation, the overall progress from the hearing was limited. There will be a further discussion of Section 201 case on October 10, and on October 23, proposals for the remedies will be released. On October 31, they will vote for the results of the remedies. Lastly, on November 13, they will send the proposals to President Trump to decide whether to implement them. During each period, if any information about the remedies is released, it will create an impact on the US market and global supply chain. October 31 is currently believed to be the time when the biggest impact will take place, as the results after voting will almost confirm the practice in the future.
For Europe, MIP will bring great damage to high price and power products once it is imposed again this year. With the barrier on the US market caused by the Section 201 case, the surplus of high power products will pressure manufacturers to reduce price in 4Q17 and to shift their attention to the mid-price market.

                                Prices Remained Flat during Holidays, Taiwanese Capacity Is in A Weak Position: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20171012-11999.html,"









On the first week after the long holidays in China and Taiwan, prices in the supply chain generally remained flat, and only high efficiency product price went down because of the decrease of MIP in Europe and the increase of mono PERC cell capacity. Because Taiwan’s capacity loses part of the demand from the US and Europe, it suffers pressure of lowering price from the market. Besides, with high material cost, the price is in a weak position this week.
Polysilicon
Under the impact of overhaul and accident, polysilicon effective capacity isn’t enough. However, with the shrinking demand from the US Section 201 case and large-scale decreasing demand from downstream such as the utility-scale ground-mounted power stations in China, supply and demand conditions aren’t tight. This week, polysilicon price mainly remains at RMB 147-150/Kg. Second-level material price and contract price become one level lower: RMB 140-145/Kg. The oversea material price of Chinese market maintains USD 18-18.5/Kg this week. Materials which have lower prices from the US and European manufacturers are lack of supplies.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer price has remained stable this week and each type of product has maintained the same condition before the holidays: diamond wire cut multi-si wafers are in shortfall, slurry wire cut multi-si wafers become secondary necessity good due to the weak demand, and the supply and demand of mono-si wafer are steady. The price of diamond wire cut multi-si wafer this week is RMB 4.5-4.8/pc. Slurry wire cut multi-si wafer price is RMB 4.9-5.2/pc, and mono-si wafer price is RMB 5.8-6/pc.
Although the overall price doesn’t change, after diamond wire cut multi-si wafer becomes the mainstream, keep an eye on whether mono-si wafer price will be forced to lower owing to the gap between mono-si and multi-si prices, easing mono PERC PV cell price from pressure.
PV cell
Under the influence of the decrease of MIP in Europe, high efficiency PV cell starts to experience the pressure of bargaining over the price this week. Especially for PERC products, because of the three factors such as the growth of mainstream efficiency, the expansion of capacity and the decrease of basic price on the market, the entire average price declines. Mono PERC products whose efficiency is below 21% is considered as insufficient efficiency. Their speed of lowering in prices may be faster in order to face new capacity competition.
On the other hand, under MIP’s regulations in EU, there are 20.5 Euro cents of gap between mono-si PV-cell and module prices, making 290-295W module prefer to finish packaging locally after purchasing oversea PV cell. Therefore, there is a difference between the demand of high and low efficiency PERC products.
On account of the downsizing of European niche market and the decrease of high efficiency product price, Taiwanese PV cells are in hardship again. In 4Q17, if there is no proper demand of Chinese distributed system or “Top Runner Program”, Taiwanese PV cells will be unable to compete during the halt of insufficient capacity from Chinese manufacturers in the short term. The prices will be under the pressure of decreasing due to the reducing outlet of shipment.
This week, mainstream price of mono-si PERC PV cell with above 21% efficiency is USD 0.3-0.32/W and 20.6-20.9% efficiency PERC PV cell price is USD 0.28-0.3/W. With the end of storage period due to Section 201 case, high efficiency products will largely be imported in Europe. It is expected that further intense competition will appear until the price reaches MIP’s range in Europe.
Module
Similarly, module price suffers pressure of lowering because of the two factors which are the decrease of MIP in Europe and the slowing demand because of the US Section 201 case. Currently, larger price drop appears in 290-300W PERC product and the decrease of 0.5-1 pennies for 300W mono-si module, making the price become USD 0.43-0.51/W. 290W is USD 0.42-0.5/W. The rest of the regular efficiency module prices remain steady. For multi-si module,owing to the improvement of technique and efficiency, the cost decreases. In the future, it will be likely to drop in order to face the competition in Chinese module tender projects.

Under the impact of the end of demand for stocking following the US Section 201 case, prices for certain products in markets such as Southeast Asia and Taiwan have started to return to normal. At the same time, activity in China’s distributed solar market is picking up. Under these developments, the overall demand on the market has become flat, making prices on the supply chain dependent on market conditions. This week, the most noticeable price changes are still in the PV cell section. Only part of the price deals for polysilicon are significant.
Polysilicon
This week, there is a slight increase in polysilicon price, and the main reason is the high price for small orders. Current price in high level is RMB 150-155/kg, though the mainstream is RMB 145-150/kg. Due to the current high price of polysilicon, the manufacturers aren’t eager to raise the price. In addition, with the uncertainty of demand on the end market, polysilicon manufacturers may follow the market trend to decide the prices.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer price remains stable this week, and there are delays of orders for some manufacturers. However, because of the uncertainty of demand in China, prices can only remain steady. Mono-si wafer price is slightly unstable. The prices of orders for large manufacturers who mainly rely on contracts aren’t under much pressure. However, middle and small manufacturers who focus on temporary demand are starting to lower prices in order to match the market condition.
PV cell
The biggest change this week is in the PV cell section. Due to the window period of the Section 201 case, the demand for stocking on the US market has decreased. Compared with Chinese manufacturers, the advantages of Taiwanese manufacturers is diminishing. This situation has caused their PV cell prices to approach the levels of their Chinese counterparts. This week, Taiwanese PV cell price is USD 0.23/W. Owing to their high reliance on China, it’s only a matter of time before the prices on both sides reach parity.
PERC PV cell price is continuing to approach the levels of Europe’s MIP. Mono-si PV-cell MIP, which is regulated by the European Union, is USD 0.28/W. Meanwhile, because the demand in the US has largely declined, high efficiency products are imported into Europe, making the competition become severe for suppliers and PERC PV cell price go down rapidly. It is expected to decrease to at least USD 0.285-0.295/W.
Module
This week, module price has slightly declined in response to the decreasing price trend of non-Chinese manufacturers. Similar to PV cell condition, under the impact of external factors such as the decreasing demand triggered by the US’s Section 201 case and the lowering MIP, suppliers from regions other than China have started to use cheap prices to maintain competitiveness; the main drop in price comes from the capacity of the third party countries that had previously raised their price in order to supply to the US since May, 2017.

The latest lithium-ion battery market report from EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, finds that the price upswing for battery cells has started to moderate since this third quarter. Although the price of cobalt reached a new high for the recent years during the third quarter, prices of battery cells have been climbing more slowly after the large hikes in the second quarter. The overall price increase in the battery cell market is anticipated to be even smaller for this fourth quarter.
By types, polymer cells saw the largest price hike this third quarter with the average increase being more than 3% compared with the prior three-month period. Both cylindrical and prismatic cells saw a smaller sequential price that averaged around 2%. Cylindrical and prismatic cells generally use cathode materials of lower cobalt content (such as NMC), so their prices are less influenced by the dynamics of the cobalt market. As for polymer cells, the upward movement of their prices in the third quarter has not been as sharp as in the second quarter. However, their average price increase was still the largest because of the costs of raw materials.
 
Notebook market makes greater contribution to the demand growth of polymer cells as brand vendors seek thinner and more efficient batteries
Polymer cells are expanding their presence in the notebook segment of the IT battery market. Duff Lu, senior research manager of EnergyTrend, pointed out that notebook makers have been striving to reduce the body thickness for the majority of their products. While prices of new and thinner notebooks are still too high to get most consumers interested in replacing their older notebooks, brand vendors are very active in incorporating very thin models into their mainstream offerings. This type of notebooks from HP and Dell, for instance, are in high demand. Therefore, notebook brands are starting to use polymer cells for their batteries as to get the best energy intensity performance out of their devices.

“Our market outlook indicates strong demand growth for IT polymer cells in the near future due to increasing adoption by notebook brands,” said Lu. “At the same time, the energy density specifications of notebook batteries are going to become comparable to those of mobile phone batteries.”
Lu also noted that more battery suppliers are shifting the focus of their product development from mobile phones to notebooks as the former application market has become less profitable due to price competition among mobile phone makers. “The shift in suppliers’ focus benefits the notebook battery market, which will see more technologically advanced products,” said Lu. “For suppliers, selling notebook batteries will also contribute to the growth of the average number of battery cells used.”
Generally, more suppliers from China such as BYD are expected to enter the notebook battery market during the first half of 2018, and this could help relieve the strain on the polymer cell supply. According to EnergyTrend, the average number of cells used in notebook battery packs is to remain constant in the second half of 2017. In the tablet segment of the IT battery market, brand vendors have significantly lowered their battery inventories. The average inventory for tablet batteries for this third quarter dropped 8% year on year to 36.2 million units per month. Meanwhile, the falling demand in the tablet battery market will negatively affect the demand for integrated polymer cell batteries.
Supply of high-density batteries for mobile phones tightens as manufacturers are more cautious in raising product specifications
In the market for batteries used in mobile phones, the polymer type’s representation in the total demand is projected to grow from 67% in the second quarter to around 70% in the third quarter. This shows that integrated cell batteries have become the mainstream for mobile phones across regional markets.
One major factor that will influence the development of polymer mobile phone batteries is whether cell suppliers can further raise the battery capacity while maintaining energy density at above the level of 730 watt-hours per kilogram. After the recall of Samsung Galaxy Note 7, cell suppliers have become more cautious in deploying solutions that allow for higher energy density. This heightened awareness of quality and safety has also constrained the overall growth of battery supply for mobile phones. In sum, finding breakthroughs on the energy density front will be key to relieving tight supply for polymer batteries used in mobile phones.

                                High Efficiency Products Compete Severely, Mono-Si PERC PV Cell Price Starts to Decline: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20171026-12019.html,"









Price trend this week has continued the trends of the last two weeks. Despite the upturn in demand, upstream polysilicon price has become unstable due to capacity overhaul; si-wafer price is in a dilemma under the impact of increasing upstream material price and decreasing downstream PV cell price; PV cell price declined because of the lowering MIP; module price started to slightly go down owing to the drop of PV cell price. This trend meets the expectations of 2016 and 2017 made by developers.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon price has slightly increased. The spot market is influenced by the delayed overhaul from Q3 to Q4 by major manufacturers. Therefore, the average sales price slightly went up. Nevertheless, the overall trend is stable.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer sector is in a seesaw battle between the upstream and downstream of the industry chain: upstream polysilicon price is still high while downstream PV cell and module prices decreased. Si-wafer manufacturers have to make a choice between profit and market. Because none of the manufacturers have reached a consensus for the market, quoted prices remain flat. The demand of diamond wire cut multi-si wafer is stable, but the output is still under the limitation of wire material and capacity. The situation has prompted some manufacturers to increase their high prices, which has caused average prices to grow.
PV cell
The quoted price of multi-si cell in Taiwan has gotten closer to China’s USD 0.225/W this week. Because the support on PV cell market transfers to China’s module manufacturers, Taiwanese manufacturers have suffered more pressures. PERC PV cell price has dropped this week. The competition has become severe after the European Union lowered the trade barrier. High efficiency mono-si PERC PV cell has to compete with low efficiency PERC and Chinese manufacturers. Besides, the demand in the US has decreased, which has turned Europe into the world’s top choice target market for high efficiency capacity. These all reflect the increasing sales pressure of high efficiency product which results in the drop of price. Currently, China-made mono-si PERC price is RMB 2.05-2.2/W and Taiwan-made mono-si PERC price is USD 0.28-0.3/W.
Module
Benefiting from the decrease in PV cell price, average module price slightly declined this week, meeting the expectation of lowering module price on the market. The world’s market demand in Q4 focuses on China, India, Japan and Turkey. In addition, there are shipments for large scale tenders in South America. The stable demand supports module and PV cell. However, the following trend still has to wait until November, when Chinese distributed system demand expands.

                                War between Mono-Si and Multi-Si Price Is About to Start: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20171102-12028.html,"

Due to the weak demand of mono-crystalline products, mono-si wafer price dropped dramatically this week, while mono-si PV-cell price also dropped. Currently, prices of mono-si and multi-si are almost at the same level. Owing to the sluggish demand on the end market, the price war of the mono-si and multi-si products which is being driven by si-wafers and PV cells is about to start.








Polysilicon
Polysilicon price this week remained stable and didn’t change much. Because downstream si-wafer orders are stable and the overhauls of polysilicon manufacturers are still ongoing, it is expected that polysilicon can maintain its price for a while.
Si-wafer
Since the end of the Oct. 1 long holiday in China, mono-si PV-cell demand has been weak. To maintain the profits of downstream PV cell manufacturers and strengthen the competitiveness of mono-si PV-cell on the market, two Chinese leading manufacturers of mono-si wafers have lowered their prices this week. The prices of their 180-micron mono-si wafers have decreased by approximately RMB 0.4/pc to RMB 5.65/pc and RMB 5.6/pc respectively. This has encouraged the other mono-si wafer manufacturers to lower their prices.
As for multi-si wafer, the overall capacity of diamond wire saw is still tight, making the demand for traditional slurry saw process grow. However, under the impact of decreasing mono-crystalline products’ prices, multi-si wafer suppliers are under increased pressure to lower their price this week.
PV cell
With the help of declining mono-si wafer price, the trend of lowering price is being led by leading manufacturers of mono-si PV-cells as well, making the price become similar to multi-si PV-cell price. This puts pressure on both multi-si PV-cell and other mono-si PV-cell manufacturers. This week, the mono-si PV-cell price of the tier-one manufacturers decreased to RMB1.73-1.77/W, making the other PV cell manufacturers lower the prices to compete later.
In terms of high efficiency mono-si PERC PV cell, there has been a larger decline. Due to the slow demand on the high efficiency market, mono-si PERC PV cell has kept accumulating. Because mono-si PERC is profitable, its price continues to drop. Presently, mono-si PERC PV cell price has decreased to RMB 2-2.1/W, and Taiwan-made mono-si PERC price has declined to USD 0.28-0.29/W. Although it is expected to drop next week, the decline will be limited.
Module
With the help of declining PV cell price, both mono-si and multi-si module prices decreased. Currently, price of 270W multi-si module is RMB 2.71-2.75/W and price of mono-si module has become RMB 2.83-2.87/W. Owing to the larger decline of mono-si PV-cell price, prices of mono-si and multi-si module will become closer.

                                Price Battle to Start between Mono-Si and Multi-Si PV Cells; Impact on the Downstream Market will Need Two to Four Weeks: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20171109-12037.html,"









After the decrease of mono-si PV-cell price last week, the PV cell sector of the supply chain this week suffered more impacts. The competition between mono-si PV-cell manufacturers became severe, and some prices dropped. Because mono-si PV-cell price largely declined last week, the module sector can slightly lower the price. However, the competition between mono-si and multi-si didn’t make much progress. Because the demand of current end market mainly comes from previous developers’ evaluation of installation requirements in the end of Q4, it still needs two to four weeks for the downstream prices of mono-si and multi-si to become the same.
Polysilicon
The peak of polysilicon manufacturers’ overhauls is over. However, because the demands of distributed system on the market are different and there are rumors about China’s double reverse tax rate being lower than 5% for the major polysilicon suppliers in Korea, and 5-10% for the other larger manufacturers, it is hard to improve the situation currently under the circumstance with uncertain demand and the lack of major developments. Polysilicon price this week, therefore, remained flat.
Si-wafer
Two leading manufacturers of mono-si wafer largely lowered the prices last week, making the prices of small manufacturers this week slightly decrease to RMB 5.6-5.7/pc. On the contrary, multi-si wafer didn’t suffer too much pressure this week. Although downstream PV cell engaged in the battle between mono-si and multi-si prices, demand of multi-si was stable and silicon wafer manufacturers didn’t suffer much pressure. Sales of diamond wire saw still remained and the price on Chinese market was RMB 4.75/W. For Taiwan’s multi-si wafers, because they mostly come from import and the demand of diamond wire saw si-wafer increased, the price was higher, at US$0.645-0.65/pc.
PV cell
As for PV cell sector, after the quick drops of mono-si PV-cell prices from some manufacturers last week, prices became the same between mono-si and multi-si and kept decreasing to fight for the markets, making the entire mono-si PV-cell price decline to RMB 1.73/W. For multi-si PV-cell, under the impact of the same prices between mono-si and multi-si, price became slightly unstable. However, price this week remained flat and it is not expected to change until next week.
The decrease of mono-si PERC PV cell price became stable this week. Price for efficiency above 21.2% was US$0.28-0.31/W and 20.8-21% was US$0.275-0.28/W. China’s quoted price was RMB 2.0-2.05/W.
Module
Due to the dramatic drop and severe competition for PV cell price, there were rooms for lowering module prices. Small and medium module manufacturers are likely to bargain and the prices on the market have decreased. Because the drop of PV cell price focused on mono-si PV-cell, the drop of module price centered on mono-si module as well.

                                Mono-Si and Multi-Si Prices Have Been Locked in a Seesaw Struggle, Entire Price in Supply Chain Drops: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20171116-12047.html,"









Under the influence of the same prices between mono-si and multi-si PV cells, the number of restocking orders in the mono-si supply chain has started to increase. However, price has remained steady since last week, as manufacturers are still clearing out their inventories. Although the restocking momentum for mono-si became strong, market condition of multi-si supply chain didn’t suffer the impact. With the support of distributed system and other international markets, sales of multi-si still remained full. Rumor has it that there will be another price decline for both mono-si and multi-si this month. However, the information hasn’t been proven yet.
Polysilicon
Because of stable downstream demand, polysilicon price basically remained the same. Actual agreed price was RMB 144-152/kg depending on the varieties of material quality and brand. The result of China’s double reverse tax rate for the polysilicon suppliers in Korea is expected to come out this month. If OCI tax rate is below 5%, prices on the market won’t be influenced much. But if it is between or above 5-10%, prices may increase slightly.
Si-wafer
Owing to the rapid decrease of mono-si PV cell price, mono-si module suppliers had more spaces for bargaining with EPC/investors, making the orders of upstream mono-si wafer increase.
Though the supply of diamond wire saw multi-si wafer increased, overall, the supply still wasn’t enough. However, due to the competitive relationship between mono-si, the average agreed price slightly went down. Meanwhile, to make multi-si PV cell remain competitive, it is rumored that the quoted prices of multi-si supply chain in December may become lower. Besides, it is rumored that the quoted prices of mono-si supply chain in December may decrease as well.
PV cell
PV cell price remained stable this week. Under the influences of China’s increasing demand of distributed system and India’s rising amount of restocking orders, inquiry of diamond wire PV cell continued to increase, boosting the demand for Taiwanese manufacturers, which allowed the prices to remain steady. Because of the decreasing PV cell price last week, mono-si supply chain increased station market’s demand for mono-si modules. However, their prices still remained flat.
In terms of mono-si PERC, after the rapid drop a few weeks ago, there was slow decrease this week. The test of China’s mono-si PERC PV cell price as RMB 2/W started this week. Next week, the price will have a chance to reach somewhere between RMB 1-2/W. Taiwan’s mono-si PERC PV cell price started to remain stable at USD 0.27-0.28/W. However, PERC PV cell price for efficiency of 20.6-20.8% may keep decreasing to the level of Chinese manufacturers.
Module
Because of the decreasing price of mono-si PV cell, there were more spaces of lowering prices for mono-si module manufacturers to accept clients’ requirements and the entire average price slightly declined. Price of the first-tier manufacturers was RMB 2.85-2.93/W. Price of the second-tier manufacturers was RMB 2.79-2.85/W. Demand for multi-si module has remained tight and its price has maintained RMB 2.7-2.8/W.
Although China’s long-rumored subsidy solution for distributed system hasn’t been released, demand for distributed system still increased. There are orders of module extending till December and the development of the installation in the end of the year has begun. Besides Chinese market, Indian market’s demand started to grow owing to the decrease of module and PV cell prices. It is expected that the situation will be more obvious in December.

                                Mono-Si PERC PV Cell Price Has Dropped, while the Rest of the Sectors Have Remained Stable: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20171123-12057.html,"









On the markets with low BOS costs such as China and India, high efficiency product mono-si PERC PV cell has weaker competitiveness in price–performance ratio. However, recently, the increasing demand of the distributed system in China on end market has made mono-si PERC price decrease. Due to the demand on the market, the rest of the sectors remained stable. Demand from the Chinese market is expected to maintain its momentum for three to four weeks. Then, the demand will turn weak. After 1Q18, it will change to India and Japan.
Polysilicon
This week, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced the result of China’s double reverse tax rate for the polysilicon suppliers in Korea. Although the average tax rate increased, the tax rate of OCI, which supplied the largest amount for China, only changed from 2.4% to 4.4%. In terms of the current price of RMB 148/kg, there is only RMB 3/kg for bargaining. Presently, sales of polysilicon have remained full. There are chances that OCI will transfer the tax rate cost to the downstream sector. However, because polysilicon price has remained high for a long time, the quoted price is likely to rise completely.Their final transaction price, on the other hand, will only experience an increase of RMB 1-2/kg.
Si-wafer
Mono-si and multi-si wafer prices have remained stable this week. However, because of the weak demand for mono-si PERC PV cell on the market, stock clearance of mono-si wafer suffered the impact again. The PV cell manufacturers, which are more flexible on the production line, have transferred part of the mono-si production line to multi-si in order to increase the utilization rate, making the unbalanced demands and supplies of diamond wire saw multi-si wafer and mono-si wafer become severe. For multi-si wafer, because mono-si wafer price didn’t fall, currently its price hasn’t declined yet. Thus, price is likely to remain steady until the middle of December.
PV cell
Because the prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer didn’t decrease, mono-si and multi-si PV cell prices basically remained flat this week, except mono-si PERC PV cell price. The reason why mono-si PERC PV cell price has declined is that the demands in Europe and the US became weak. Under the influences of the removal of MIP by the European Union and the sluggish demand on the US market, mono-si PERC had to reduce previous high profit in order to maintain its competitiveness compared with other competitors which had higher price–performance ratio. In addition, because the weak situation on the markets in Europe and the US will remain until 1Q18, mono-si PERC had to speed up increasing the price–performance ratio to take over Japanese market and Chinese market of distributed system in 1Q18.
Module
With the support of lowering prices on the supply chains in previous weeks, module price decreased as well and part of the end demand appeared. Meanwhile, because the demand of distributed system in China started to reach its peak, the market this week experienced a boom instead of the sluggish situation in late October. However, because the demand still focused on Chinese local market and some overseas markets which pursued price–performance ratio, demand for high efficiency product was poor, lowering the prices of Southeast Asia’s and Korea’s manufacturers which mainly exported goods to Europe and the US.
Module demand is expected to remain steady in China until the middle of December, before shifting into markets such as India and Japan in 1Q18.

This week, the entire price in solar supply chain didn’t change much; however, there are still a number of noteworthy developments. Demands of mono-si and multi-si continued to show opposite trends, and the mono-si supply chain suffered more pressures. This trend is expected to continue into the near future. In terms of the future market prices, they will start to reflect the increase of mono-si inventory and the insufficient supply of diamond wire saw multi-si wafer.
Polysilicon
Although the result of China’s double reverse tax rate for the polysilicon suppliers in Korea has been released, because it mainly influenced mono-si and the tax rate didn’t change much, the impact on the entire average price was small. Only quoted price range expanded.
Polysilicon prices in China varied depending on materials quality, manufacturer and payment method, remaining basically at RMB 146-154/kg. For the market, due to the demand of downstream multi-si wafer, current supply and demand of polysilicon are still tight. However, the overhauls of polysilicon industry have come to the end. Thus, the supply in late December will increase. Yet, the price on the market will likely decline starting from late December. Currently, there are only a few amounts of spot goods, and only some dealers have responded to the change of double reverse tax rate. The entire price has a small chance to increase.
Si-wafer
Mono-si and multi-si wafer prices this week didn’t change. However, there were two different trends because the end demands for mono-si and multi-si products weren’t the same: the demand for multi-si wafer was tight, while the demand for mono-si wafer remained weak.
Though the quoted prices of mono-si wafer from the major manufacturers remained the same, spot market suffered more pressures due to the insufficient demand of downstream high efficiency products, making some spot prices start to drop and the bottom price reach RMB 5.5/pc.
For multi-si wafer, because diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price was RMB 0.05/W lower than slurry saw multi-si PV cell price, orders tended to come from diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell, boosting the demand for diamond wire saw multi-si wafer and causing insufficient supply. However, owing to the uncertainty of future market and the maintenance of competitive advantage against mono-si, quoted prices of diamond wire saw multi-si wafer from manufacturers mostly remained flat.
PV cell
This week, multi-si PV cell price stayed the same. Yet, because the market share of diamond wire saw PV cell, which has lower average price, became higher, the entire average price of multi-si PV cell slightly decreased. This week, diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.66-1.71/W and the main low-priced product was color shift product; slurry saw multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.72-1.74/W.
For mono-si PV cell, because of the weak end demand, output and sales volume of mono-si decreased, especially for the mono-si PV cells in Taiwan. Because they gradually lost the advantage of trade barrier, the price dropped deeply, making the distance between mono-si PV cell prices from Chinese manufacturers become short. This week, mono-si PV cell price from Taiwanese manufacturers was USD 0.24-0.245/W. Chinese manufacturers’ price was RMB 1.68-1.73/W. Mono-si PERC PV cell price has kept decreasing. The price from Taiwanese manufacturers dropped to USD 0.255-0.265/W. The lowest price from Chinese manufacturers has approached RMB 1.9/W, forcing the general mono-si PV cell price to go down.
Module
This week, because of the downstream strong demand, multi-si module price was quite stable relatively. The price from Chinese first-tier manufacturers reached RMB 2.75-2.8/W and the second-tier manufacturers’ price was RMB 2.7-2.75/W. Mono-si and high efficiency module prices went down owing to the decrease of PV cell price, especially for 290-300W mono-si PERC module. Its price kept declining due to downstream weak demand. Module price this week was around USD 0.39-0.46/W. The lowest price for 290W module has become close to the general mono-si prices of USD 0.37/W and RMB 2.88/W.
During October and November in 2017, the US market has become a risky one because of Section 201 petition. Driven by benefits and shipping goals, some module manufacturers chose the end of December as the deadline and shipped to the US to accumulate the goods, making the inventory in the US increase. The main shipment was multi-si module and it became one of the main supports for recent demand on the multi-si market.

This week, the price movements are mostly concentrated in the mono-si supply chain. Because there were sufficient inventories for mono-si wafer and mono-si PV cell, the prices in this week have dropped, making the gap between multi-si wafer price become small. On the other hand, multi-si supply chain has largely turned to diamond wire saw technology, making mono-si products suffer great competitive pressure on prices.
This week, the prices of mono-si PV cells have fallen below those of slurry saw multi-si PV cells. Mono-si wafer price per watt has been lower than slurry saw multi-si wafer price per watt. This drop for mono-si prices is expected to be improved after the third week of December.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon price this week was stable. However, the average price of dense materials for mono-si slightly increased, enlarging the range of high price. The spread between mono-si materials and multi-si materials has been expanding gradually and has approached RMB 15/kg.
Si-wafer
Multi-si wafer this week was steady. Owing to some manufacturers’ decreasing demand for wire saw of mono-si, the strained supply of wafers made from diamond wire saws has eased. In terms of mono-si wafer, the price went down due to the recent weak demand and inventory pressure. The leading manufacturers of mono-si wafer had their own capacities of PV cell and module, so the decreases were smaller; however, during the current condition of sluggish mono-si market and the transition of PV cell manufacturers into multi-si, other small and mid-sized manufacturers which didn’t have downstream product lines suffered more inventory pressure and the decreases were obvious. This week, the mainstream price of mono-si wafer was RMB 5.4-5.5/pc, and overseas price, which is still falling, was USD 0.72-0.74/pc. The low level price from some small manufacturers has reached RMB 5.0-5.1/pc and the general price was RMB 5.2-5.3/pc.
PV cell
This week, slurry saw multi-si PV cell price has been RMB 1.71-1.74/W and diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.66-1.7/W. Mono-si PV cell price has declined to RMB 1.68-1.7/W, which was similar to diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price. Mono-si PERC PV cell price has kept decreasing as well. Taiwan’s mono-si PERC PV cell price for efficiency of 21-21.2% was USD 0.255-0.262/W, almost approaching Chinese manufacturers’ price of RMB 1.9-2/W.
Module
The main demands of this month came from Chinese subsidy program, which had impacts on investing starters and price–performance ratio, and distributed market. Although the spread between mono and multi-si PV cell became small, the end market hasn’t reacted to the decrease in prices for mono-si supply chain because of the time difference between designing project and actual order and the spread between mono and multi-si module.
After two weeks, it is expected that the market demand will start to become weak after the end of shipping season in the end of the year. A short empty period of demand will occur, pulling the prices of mono and multi-si modules closer. Then, mono-si demand will improve. The condition of price drop for mono-si wafer and PV cell for weeks will have been solved as well.

This week, the focus of the market was on the change of the mono-si supply chain. Due to the rapid decline of mono-si price, the demand of this week has improved, and some PV cell manufacturers can finally stop inventory accumulation. Yet, because mono-si wafer’s supply was sufficient, its inventory has become full.
Polysilicon
Because of the increase of China’s antidumping duties for the polysilicon suppliers in Korea and the continuous downstream orders, the supply of polysilicon was still tight, and the entire price slightly increased. The polysilicon price for mono-si remained at RMB 152-157/kg, and the polysilicon price for multi-si was RMB 146-152/kg.
Si-wafer
Although the downstream demand for mono-si wafer was weak, some manufacturers eased the pressure of lowering price by digesting inventory on their own, making si-wafer price this week become stable. However, the small manufacturers who were unable to digest on their own still had to lower their prices.
As the inventory of PV cell manufacturers started to decrease, mono-si wafer price can have chance to remain stable. Though the decline of mono-si PV cell price increased the price–performance ratio of mono-si products, owing to the unbalance of the entire supply and demand, the price trend of mono-si in the short-term still became weak. Under the circumstances, because of the well condition of the first-tier manufacturers, the orders of multi-si wafer have been extended to January, and the price remained steady.
PV cell
The end market started to purchase mono-si products. Besides, more PV cell manufacturers lowered the percentage of mono-si PV cell production line. The speed of accumulating inventory for mono-si PV cell has become slow. This week, the mainstream mono-si PV cell price was RMB 1.68-1.7/W, which was almost close to diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price. After a week, the spread increased the willingness of purchasing mono-si products in the market. Like si-wafer sector, although the normal mono-si PV cell price can stop from decreasing, the trend was still weak. However, because the availability and supply for mono-si PV cell production line declined, the unbalance between supply and demand can be improved quickly.
Module
The demand for December mainly came from Chinese subsidy program, the year-end sales of distributed system and the demand before the start of section 201 petition. In addition, because of the seasonal demand in 1Q18 for India and Japan, the orders became higher in December. Although the main demand focused on multi-si, with the participation of Japanese market and the change from multi-si to mono-si for the demand of few Chinese distributed systems, the demand of mono-si started to be improved.

Prices of mono-Si wafers and cells were more stable to some degree in the week of 21 December 2017. Although small- and medium-size suppliers lowered their prices as demand was still sluggish, the price decline began to moderate because product margins are already razor thin. First-tier suppliers of mono-Si products have been the main beneficiaries of the demand in China, India, and Japan. Furthermore, they still have to complete some deferred overseas orders. Therefore, prices of mono-Si products from first-tier suppliers are expected to remain steady to January 2018 as they will continue to process orders until that time.
China has released its 2018 FIT scheme, the US government is expected to make a major announcement on solar trade before the Chinese New Year. The solar PV market will be following closely on the policies of the two countries in the near future.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon section of the supply chain has been receiving copious amounts of orders during this December. Prices have also gone up due to occasions of demand outpacing supply. From the production side, issues concerning plant operations (including malfunctioning of the power generation system) have constrained the overall output. From the market side, major suppliers of mono-Si wafers have stepped up their purchases to ensure they have sufficient inventory. Pressures from both ends therefore have tightened the supply. In China, polysilicon prices for clients in the mono-Si and multi-Si markets for the week of 21 December stood around RMB 153-158/kg and 147-154/kg, respectively. Prices of polysilicon outside China (on the international market) were within the range of USD 14.5-18.6/kg.
Wafers
Market demand has managed to keep prices of multi-Si wafers stable. Wafer suppliers are also switching to diamond wire (DW) slicing, but the production of diamond wire has not been growing at a sufficient pace to keep up with the transition. As wafer suppliers allocate more of their processing capacity to DW slicing, they have found that there is not enough diamond wire available. This has emerged as the main factor behind the recent supply bottleneck for multi-Si wafers.
For week of 21 December, prices from the leading mono-Si wafer suppliers were around RMB 5.3-5.5/pc (or USD 0.71-0.73/pc), while prices from the second-tier suppliers were generally around RMB 5.1-5.3. Some small- and medium-size suppliers of mono-Si wafers had lowered their prices to RMB 4.8-5/pc in order to clear their inventories by the end of the year. Nevertheless, the demand for mono-Si products is rising, so the price trend of mono-Si wafers is expected to be stable in the following week. 
Cells
Prices of multi-Si cells remained constant this week, whereas prices of mono-Si cells experienced fluctuations. Prices of multi-Si cells from DW-sliced wafers were maintained within RMB 1.66-1.7/W (USD 0.216-0.22/W). Prices of mono-Si PERC cells by contrast had fallen below RMB 1.8/W due to Chinese cell suppliers undercutting each other. In China, prices of mono-Si PERC cells were RMB 1.75-1.9/W in the week of 21 December. Prices of mono-Si PERC cells from Taiwanese suppliers stopped falling and came to USD 0.25-0.265/W during the same period.
Modules
Prices were generally stable for modules. To spread the demand over a longer period, major module suppliers have outsourced their orders and will continue with their production until January 2018. On the other hand, the recent wave of demand in China’s distributed generation (DG) market is starting to subside. Medium- and small-size module suppliers are seeing less orders for January and expressing worries about the future of the market. The Chinese government has announced FIT reduction for DG systems starting on 1 January 2018. However, there will be some remnant demand related to China’s FIT market. In addition, there is still some unfulfilled demand related to the objectives of the Top Runner Program for 2017.

This week, owing to the announcement of lowering on-grid prices from NDRC, the local demand grew, bringing a few supports for the demand in January, 2018. In terms of supply chain, because of the expectation of weak demand for 1Q18, both mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer manufacturers have lowered the quoted prices of January to strengthen their competitiveness in the downstream sector. Thus, the focus is still on the war between mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer. Both sides will focus on each other’s range of spread to reduce prices.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon section this week was similar to last week. Under the impact of downstream si-wafer demands and the material inventory strategies from some si-wafer manufacturers, the demand remained strong. Some prices slightly increased, but there was a limitation to their growth.
Si-wafer
Although the demands of mono-si products were improved, to increase the competitiveness of mono-si products in 1Q18, the mono-si wafer’s leading manufacturers actively lowered their prices by RMB 0.2/pc, making the quoted price reach RMB 5.3-5.4/pc. The quoted price in US dollars reached USD 0.71-0.72/pc, prompting other mono-si wafer manufacturers to reduce their prices. However, owing to the previous bad condition of mono-si on the market and differences between strike prices and quoted prices, the actual impact this time was lower than RMB 0.12/pc.
On the other hand, in order to maintain the spread, the multi-si wafermanufacturers decreased the prices as well. Yet, since it happened unexpectedly, currently there are still some manufacturers without adjusted prices. It is expected that there will be a complete decrease in prices. Diamond wire saw multi-si wafer price this week was RMB 4.5-4.7/pc. Slurry sawing multi-si wafer price was RMB 4.8-5/pc.
PV cell
Although mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer lowered the quoted prices this week, PV cell manufacturers are expected to reduce the prices next week. This week, mono-si PV cell price was RMB 1.68-1.7/W and around USD 0.23/W in US dollars. Diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price remained at RMB 1.66-1.7/W and USD 0.215-0.22/W in US dollars.
In terms of PERC cell, though the price declined this week, it started to become stable. Due to the rising demands on Japanese and European markets, it is expected that PERC products’ requirements can be increased with the competitiveness brought by previous decrease.
Module
Under the influence of the decrease for on-grid prices, this week there were some installations before the end of 2017. Since time wasn’t enough, the numbers of installations were low. However, because many systems opted to connect the grid first, the orders will be extended until January, increasing the short-term demand domestically.
In addition, owing to the increased demands in India and Japan and the continuous supply for some massive overseas tenders, the entire demand in January will remain. Yet, because the total demand in 1Q18 is largely lower than the supply, it is expected that the future module price will tend to decrease according to the prices reduction on the upstream sector such as si-wafer and PV cell.

Last week, the decrease of si-wafer prices has influenced the downstream PV cell manufacturers. However, because there are differences between the previous price trends of mono-si PV cell and multi-si PV cell, plus, their shipping markets are different, the decreases were not the same. The decrease of multi-si PV cell prices was greater because of the declining orders from China; yet, because mono-si PV cell prices of December have largely lowered and the orders from Japan increased after January, the decrease of mono-si PV cell prices was smaller.
Changes of prices in other sectors were stable. However, the exchange rate of the RMB to the US dollar has generally risen.
Polysilicon
Although the demand from end market after January was lower than December, owing to the lack of inventory for polysilicon, the price this week didn’t change much. The price of polysilicon used by multi-si wafer was RMB 147-154/kg, while the price of polysilicon used by mono-si wafer was RMB 153-158/kg.
Si-wafer
Because the major manufacturers of mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer reduced the prices last week, lots of si-wafer manufacturers lowered the prices as well this week, making the average price decline slightly. Diamond wire saw multi-si wafer price was RMB 4.5-4.65/pc and USD 0.635-0.65/pc in US dollars. In terms of mono-si wafer, the demand slightly grew and some manufacturers have decreased their prices last week. Therefore, the decline was smaller. The price of the first-tier manufacturers was RMB 5.2-5.4/pc. The price of the second-tier manufacturers was RMB 5.1-5.25/pc. Besides, the price in US dollars was USD 0.7/pc.
PV cell
Because of the decreasing prices of mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer last week, PV cell price this week started to show a general decline. Diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.64-1.68/W and USD 0.212-0.217/W in US dollars. However, China’s domestic demand turned weak and the main order came from overseas market, making the orders and sales of domestic demand-based middle- and small-manufacturers go down.
In terms of mono-si, because the supply was lower than last week and the demand slightly grew, the price remained stable this week. Mono-si PV cell price was RMB 1.66-1.69/W.
Module
Though Japan and India’s demands for module started to rise, China’s domestic demand was low, resulting in the differentiation in orders. China’s first-tier and second-tier manufacturers, which have the ability to export goods, had plenty of orders. Yet, for the manufacturers which focus on local market, their orders decreased significantly.
This week, the module price gradually declined. The 270-275W multi-si module price was RMB 2.68-2.76/W. The 280-285W mono-si module price was RMB 2.76-2.81/W. The 290-300W mono-si PERC module price was RMB 2.83-2.95/W.

Tier-one manufacturers received enough orders for January. However, because the demand of the China market tended to be weak, tier-two or –three manufacturers who target China market experienced decreasing amount of orders. Meanwhile, tier-one manufacturers' out-sourcing orders fell in the same time. Thus, market sentiment was down. In particular, prices of PV cell and module were more unstable. Because mid- and small-sized manufactures dumped the inventory to exchange for cash at the end of 2017, the average price was pressed down.
Polysilicon
This week, the average spot price of polysilicon slightly rose for two main reasons below. First, the sources of the raw material for polysilicon were in shortage in the international community. For example, USA's Wacker Chemie AG polysilicon factory still had no raw materials. Next, traders dare not purchase hastily because in the near future, price of polysilicon raw material might go down. 
Because the outlook of demand in the downstream market kept on being weak, polysilicon price might go down at the second half of January 2018. Currently, polysilicon is sold out (in January). However, the demand of domestic market in China is predicted to stay weak at least until the end of Chinese New Year, and downstream multi-si wafer price is still moving down. Therefore, some polysilicon prices might begin to fall at the beginning of February.
This week, price of polysilicon for multi-si products ranged from RMB 147~154/kg, and price of polysilicon for mono-si products ranged from RMB 153~158/kg. In the non-China region, polysilicon price was USD 15~19/kg.
Si Wafer
Because tier-one module houses' orders are still enough, mono- and multi-si wafer prices of tier-one wafer foundries remained unchanged. However, some small size si wafer foundries began to sell wafer in a lower prices. For instance, some prices of mono-si wafer were below RMB 5/pc, and some prices of multi-si wafer were lower than RMB 4.2/pc. They are projected to influence the market sentiment of the second half of January. During this week, tier-one and –two mono-si wafer prices were RMB 5.1~5.4/pc. Diamond wire cut multi-si wafer's prices were RMB 4.45~4.6/pc.
PV Cells
On the one hand, mono-si and multi-si PV cells were against each other in a price war. For example, diamond wire cut multi-si PV cell price (RMB 1.65/W) was too high to reach a deal. The mainstream mono si PV cell price was even lower than the lows of diamond wire cut multi-si PV cell price. 
On the other hand, because the demand of domestic market in China was sluggish, PV cell prices this week were unstable. This week diamond wire cut multi-si PV cell price ranged from RMB 1.63~1.65/W. Mono-si PV cell ranged from RMB 1.62~1.66/W.
Modules
This week module prices in the market were also unstable. Mono-si PV modules were pressed more to lower prices, so the price gap between mono-si and multi-si PV modules was quickly shrinking. Some multi-si modules' prices even became higher than mono-si modules' prices. This week, multi-si module prices ranged from RMB 2.68~2.78/W. Mono-si module prices ranged from RMB 2.68~2.85/W. The severe price war made price range apparently broaden and made price distribution become unstable.
Moreover, the major demand in 1Q18 is the India market. India's Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) proposed to impose a 70% safeguard duty on solar power equipment for 200 days. It will require further review by the India authority, but potential risks might lead India's demand of China's capacity to shift to other countries.

Polysilicon
Polysilicon price has remained stable this week. However, owing to weak end demand, some downstream si-wafer and PV cell capacities have been shut down. Some polysilicon manufacturers may lower their prices in the end of January, and there will be large-scale price reduction for the orders in February. In terms of overseas polysilicon prices, due to the impacts of supply shortfall and risk control factors, currently they show no sign of moving down.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer price was steady this week. As mono-si PV cell price and mono-si module price quickly moved toward multi-si, the price–performance ratio of mono-si products massively increased and mono-si wafer demand bounced back. Yet, because the overall demand on the market was still weak and there wasn’t enough demand for si-wafer, the price tended to be low.
In terms of multi-si wafer, because the demand declined this week, the price generally decreased RMB 0.05/pc. The mainstream price of diamond wire saw multi-si wafer came to RMB 4.4-4.55/pc. For the average price in USD, because there wasn’t much manufacturers reducing the prices, the price was between USD 0.62-0.64/pc. However, the average price slightly went down. Overall, the spread between multi-si wafer prices and mono-si wafer prices has been widened.
PV cell
Owing to demand reduction and project postponement, downstream module manufacturers started to stop purchasing PV cells. Besides, mono-si PV cell price rapidly drew near last week, making multi-si PV cell prices drop respectively during the sluggish market condition in January. This week, diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price decreased to RMB 1.58-1.62/W, which is slightly lower than mono-si PV cell price.
Mono-si PV cell price didn’t change much this week and remained at RMB 1.62-1.66/W. Currently mono-si PV cell demand is slightly improving. Whether the price will drop next week will depend on the actual strategy of each manufacturer.
Module
Although tier-one module manufacturers had high capacity utilization through scheduling order and overseas demand, the demand has weakened owing to various factors. These factors include the dramatic decrease of China’s demand in January. The demand of distributed system in the end of December has mostly completed. The uncertainty of India, the main market in Q1, has increased because of recent trade issues. The module manufacturers will first cut down the order of PV cell, making the influence of the decreasing end-market demand approach to upstream supply chain and boosting price reduction for the supply chain. By Chinese New Year, module price is expected to decrease slowly on a weekly basis; after Chinese New Year, the price will remain stable due to the implementation of big projects.
Explanation for the Adjustment of Price Trend Structure
This week, Energy Trend widely rearranged the price trend content sector, separating RMB and USD. Both prices respectively represent the average prices for Chinese market and non-Chinese market.
The price trend model in the past was the mixed price on the international market. Therefore, after the separation this week, the prices in USD will change discontinuously because of the differences in quoted price foundation. Generally, the average price of non-Chinese market may become a little higher than the previous mixed price of the international market.
This week, the module manufacturers’ slow speed in purchasing PV cells has resulted in intensive price reduction for multi-si PV cell. In terms of mono-si products, because of the previous close spread and increasing price–performance ratio, the price was stable this week. It is expected that the price decreasing effect can influence the upstream and downstream and can urge mono-si products to lower the prices.

Chinese New Year is around the corner. The end market of solar energy has become weak. Because the module dealers’ demand for cells decreased, cell dealers had to sell with a lower price. However, the China-based market is quite sluggish before Chinese New Year. It is hard to find buyers even after the prices are reduced. Therefore, the prices of the entire supply chain has dropped.
Polysilicon
The pressure to reduce price has spread from the module to polysilicon markets, prompting some small manufacturers in China to lower their price. Although the entire polysilicon price didn’t decline dramatically, it is expected to go down next week. The lowest price of the material for multi-si wafer can be lower than RMB 140/kg. The material price for mono-si wafer was more stable and can remain at RMB 150/kg.
Si-wafer
Because there were a lot of cells being sold in a lower price, si-wafer price started to slump. In terms of mono-si wafer, due to its steady demand, the decrease was smaller. Only the leading manufacturer LONGI slightly lowered the price this week. Before Chinese New Year, prices from major mono-si wafer manufacturers are expected to be above RMB 5/pc.
Because there were time differences for the cell price reduction effect on si-wafer, multi-si wafer price has decreased since this week and will reach RMB 3.8~4/pc next week to react the current diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price. Owing to the intense decrease of multi-si wafer price, the spread between mono-si wafer and diamond wire saw multi-si wafer enlarged to RMB 0.8/pc.
PV cell
The module demand for cells has decreased, prompting cell dealers to sell with a lower price. Thus, PV cell price this week slumped. In the future, plan of reducing production will have to be conducted to decrease the inventory level.
Mono-si PV cell price has dropped for three months in 4Q17. It almost reached the same price as multi-si PV cell. Thus, its price became competitive after January. Meanwhile, most mono-si PV cell manufacturers have partly reduced the production or adjusted the production line in advance, so they only experienced minor impact. In comparison, diamond wire saw multi-si PV cell price largely decreased to RMB 1.4~1.5/W. It is expected to affect upstream multi-si wafer next week.
Because multi-si PV cell price massively dropped, the spread between mono-si PV cell and multi-si PV cell increased again. In the future, it would be worth paying attention to the mono-si PV cell price strategy from the major manufacturers. Yet, because Chinese New Year is near, some small manufacturers have started taking days off; after this sell-off for cells, the entire cell production will be reduced, and the capacity will be retrieved in March.
Module
This week, prices of mono-si module and multi-si module have decreased steadily. Because Chinese New Year is near and the snowy weather in China is getting worse, the constructions have been stopped. The situation is expected to be improved in March.
The result of the US Section 201 trade case has been announced on January 22. From February 7, the US will impose 30% tariff on solar cell and module imports and there is a tax free quota of 2,500 MW each year. Meanwhile, some developing countries such as India, Turkey and Brazil are excluded from Section 201 trade case. This will give them the incentive to turn their attention to the US market. In the future, the module’s regional supply and demand balance may change.

Polysilicon
The inventories of all large polysilicon manufacturers were short in January. Besides, there were many orders extending till February with the demand on the market. Thus, these manufacturers will not suffer price reduction pressure before Chinese New Year. Prices in February can therefore be maintained at RMB 145~150/kg. Yet, the weak market condition may cause tension for medium and small manufacturers. In February, some medium and small manufacturers will be likely to lower prices. It is expected that prices of RMB 135~140/kg may occur on the market in February.
Besides, the polysilicon price trends for mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer were different. Because mono-si manufacturers have inventory strategies, the material price for mono-si wafer can remain at a high level and the material price for multi-si wafer may go down.
Si-wafer
Under the impact of PV cell price reduction last week, si-wafer price this week continued to decrease. Meanwhile, because the PV cell quoted price this week still declined, si-wafer price will be likely to go down next week.
This week, price from large multi-si wafer manufacturers reached around RMB 4/pc. In addition, owing to the entire weak market trend, price before Chinese New Year may decrease to RMB 3.8-4/pc. If the leading manufacturer keeps producing, price will decline under weak demand, affecting the entire multi-si wafer supply.
Overall, because of the bad market condition, mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer still suffered high sales pressure. However, because the leading manufacturer of mono-si wafer may exchange si-wafer for cell OEM and module manufacturing, the inventory pressure is expected to shift to the module sector and reducing mono-si wafer’s sales pressure. Thus, currently price of mono-si wafer is more stable than multi-si wafer.
PV cell
This week, PV cell still suffered inventory and sales pressure. Followed by last week’s RMB 1.4/W, price this week decreased to RMB 1.35~1.38/W. The market condition was poor and sales pressure continued. However, this week, some makers started to reduce or halt capacity; thus, price reduction has been improved. It is expected that the following decrease will depend on si-wafer sector.
Taiwan has been influenced by the entire bad market condition. PV cell price this week has been less than US$0.2/W.
Module
Some mono-si wafer manufacturers transferred the inventory pressure to module, making module’s competitive pressure grow. At the same time, because the market demand weakened, the competition of module supplying sector became quite severe, resulting in price reduction.
On the other hand, Taiwan and Korea have announced that they will appeal the US Section 201 trade case to WTO. After releasing the Section 201 trade case for a while, some manufacturers have started the production project in the US. Yet, recently they have been halted due to price–performance ratio problem. Nevertheless, when the module capacity in the US expands, it will bring benefit to Taiwan’s cell manufacturers.

Polysilicon
The decrease of prices for PV cell and si-wafer in January was quite large. Many medium and small manufacturers needed polysilicon price reduction to gain profits. Thus, they expected the prices of polysilicon used for mono-si and multi-si to be lower than at least RMB 140/kg and RMB 130/kg, respectively. In some cases, some even demanded the prices to be under RMB 120/kg. Yet, because the inventories of most polysilicon manufacturers were short and currently these manufacturers don’t suffer much sales pressure, the chance for price reduction was small, leading to a deadlock between the polysilicon manufacturers and clients. This has caused the numbers of transactions in the spot market to fall. Currently, the polysilicon orders are mostly the ones signed previously.
This week, the price of polysilicon for mono-si was RMB 140-145/kg, while the price of polysilicon for multi-si was RMB 130-138/kg. The polysilicon demand will start to bounce back in March. However, due to the massive-scale production halt from the mid- and downstream supply chain in February, if the polysilicon manufacturers are unable to endure the inventory pressure, afterwards, the price may decrease and meet the si-wafer manufacturers’ expected standard.
Si-wafer
Because multi-si PV cell still suffered the pressure of price reduction, the price of multi-si wafer this week declined. However, the overall rate of decline has become smaller. The leading manufacturers of mono-si wafer largely lowered the prices this week in order to maintain the target spread among multi-si wafers. This week, both prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer decreased.
Because the decreasing speed of si-wafer price was quite fast two weeks ago, downstream PV cell manufacturers didn’t dare to purchase; besides, the manufacturers weren’t sure about the demand after Chinese New Year, so the transaction status was weak. This week, mono-si wafer price reached RMB 4.65-5.1/pc and USD 0.65-0.71/pc. Multi-si wafer price reached RMB 3.7-4/pc and USD 0.54-0.56/pc.
As the reduction of PV cell price slows down, si-wafer price reduction trend is expected to come to a halt in February. This will allow suppliers to gain profits again from upstream polysilicon price negotiation.
PV cell
This week, multi-si PV cell price continued to fall, but the decrease was smaller. The price was RMB 1.32-1.35/W. The price of Taiwanese PV cell reached USD 0.19/W; yet, owing to the relatively large spread between Chinese manufacturers, the price is expected to drop further. Two weeks ago, mono-si PV cell price didn’t decrease massively like multi-si PV cell price, but it slightly decreased for three weeks. Because the current spread between mono-si and multi-si PV cell has reached RMB 0.2/W, afterwards, mono-si PV cell price is expected to decline followed by the decrease of mono-si wafer price to increase the competitiveness on the market.
Module
Because of the sluggish market in China and PV cell price reduction, module price has kept decreasing since January. With the weak demand on the entire market and the declining module price, the price–performance ratio of mono-si PERC module has grown dramatically and become the mainstream on the mono-si market.
After Chinese New Year, the installation in China, which was postponed in January due to heavy snow, is expected to be unfolded again; besides, with the demand from the European market in March, the entire market after March is expected to bounce back.

With the Lunar New Year around the corner, Chinese manufacturers for each sector had shut down their productions last week, affecting the supply and demand of the international market. This has caused the market’s trading prices to fluctuate rather unpredictably. For some overseas markets except China, there was demand for inventory before Lunar New Year, making the midstream and downstream prices stop falling and even increase slightly. Yet, upstream polysilicon prices still declined.
	With the suspension of the productions in China, the output for products such as modules, PV cells and si-wafers all decreased dramatically. Quoted prices, price trends and transactions, on the other hand, have become sluggish. Overall, the market did not change much compared with the week before. However, due to some productions, PV cell and si-wafer manufacturers have tried to reach deals through price reductions. This week, both buyers and sellers have reached an agreement in price.
	Si-wafer price basically remained stable. Because of demand, mono-si product price could remain steady. Due to Lunar New Year and the stable market share, multi-si product price stopped decreasing before Lunar New Year. Mono-si and multi-si PV cell prices reached RMB 1.5-1.52/W and RMB 1.33-1.35/W separately. Owing to the restocking demand from the overseas market, Taiwanese PV cell shipment volume increased slightly this week. However, its price has been lowered a little and was close to Chinese PV cell price
	This week, upstream polysilicon prices varied. On one hand, there were differences between the quoted prices from major manufacturers and the expected demand on the market, making the seesaw struggle extend toward polysilicon; on the other hand, owing to Lunar New Year, the decrease or halt in midstream and downstream capacity resulted in the fall of urgency for demand, massively affecting the trading volume of polysilicon. The above two reasons led to great spread of polysilicon trading prices this week. Yet, the overall polysilicon price decreased. The price of polysilicon for multi-si reached RMB 128-135/kg. The quoted price of polysilicon for mono-si was RMB 140/kg owing to less trading volume; however, its trading price has declined to RMB 135-140/kg.

Prices of the first week after Chinese New Year generally dropped. Besides, the price trend of polysilicon gained most of the attention on the market. With the bigger decrease of polysilicon price, there were more spaces for price reduction on the downstream, reflecting the current weak condition on the market.








Polysilicon
Polysilicon price has started to decline before Chinese New Year. After Chinese New Year, due to the decreasing demand, the price dropped to RMB 115-135/kg. In addition, the material price for mono-si was RMB 128-135/kg. Suffering from larger oversupply pressure, the material price for multi-si has reached RMB 115/kg. However, its average price was around RMB 120/kg. Although the price which the downstream required has kept decreasing, because the current inventory bearing capability of polysilicon manufacturers is stronger and there will be medium and large capacity overhauled in March and April, price in early March won’t decrease much. The key point depends on the end market in the end of March.
Si-wafer
The competition between mono-si and multi-si wafers has been reignited after Chinese New Year. Mono-si wafer leading manufacturers lowered the price to RMB 4.55/pc and USD 0.63/pc first, bringing the price reduction pressure to multi-si wafer. Thus, multi-si wafer leading manufacturers decreased the quoted price in March to RMB 3.8/pc and USD 0.535/pc, maintaining the spread of USD 0.08-0.1/pc. Because mono-si and multi-si leading manufacturers reduced their prices, other manufacturers followed the trend. Owing to the improving demand on the market, orders have increased when prices fell. The decrease in March is expected to slow down.
PV cell
This week, PV cell price was stable. Although there was price squeeze from overseas demand during Chinese New Year, overall speaking, the shipment volume turned better. Prices of mono-si and multi-si were stable. This week, with the decrease of mono-si and multi-si wafer prices, PV cell is expected to suffer price reduction pressure. Multi-si PV cell price in March will be RMB 1.28-1.32/W. Mono-si PERC PV cell price will reach RMB 1.55-1.6/W.
Module
Due to the weak demand after Chinese New Year in China, price and operating rate are in a weak position. Yet, with the rapid decline of module price and the approach of spring, demand of distributed system has slightly bounced back. The demand of large projects will begin in the end of March and overseas demand will be combined. Demand on the market will start to grow.

The sluggish market before Chinese New Year has caused a decrease in price in each sector of the supply chain. After Chinese New Year, there were bad news for the market. For example, it has been rumored that China’s subsidy would be further lowered this year. A low bid price for the Top Runner Program has also appeared in Baicheng, and the prices of polysilicon is still falling. These have all resulted in the expectation of a poor performance in the supply chain.
Polysilicon
Some have projected that polysilicon price may become lower than RMB 100/kg, as the prices for this week have kept decreasing. The average polysilicon price in China has already dropped to RMB 120/kg this week. However, as the upstream polysilicon manufacturers have already reached an agreement on the reserve price, the price decrease for this week has slightly eased. In addition, because the current market hasn’t completely bounced back and the market demand may remain stable after the 630 installation rush, some polysilicon manufacturers are expected to start undergoing maintenance in March and April. This is expected to help make the prices more stable.
Si-wafer
After the leading manufacturers of mono-si wafer lowered the quoted prices at the end of February, the leading manufacturers of multi-si wafer have decreased the prices in early March as well. Other manufacturers are expected to follow the trend. Therefore, Chinese diamond wire saw multi-si wafer price this week fell. However, in terms of mono-si wafer price, owing to the downstream stable demand and the previous modification, its price didn’t change this week.
PV cell
The European market will rebound this year. For Taiwan, there will be an installation rush before the two-year photovoltaic project before June 30th. Thus, these two markets may boost the demand for mono-si PERC PV cell and make mono-si PERC PV cell become steady.
By comparison, because the market hasn’t fully rebounded, multi-si PV cell and the general mono-si PV cell have continued to go down. Yet, the decrease has become slow. In domestic China, multi-si PV cell price basically remained stable.
Module
Under the impact that the current market hasn’t fully rebounded, module price declined, but the decrease was shortened largely. Afterwards, with the 630 installation rush in China, it is expected to improve the decreasing prices of the supply chain from a few weeks ago.

In February, price reduction on the supply chain resulted from the weak demand on end market. Yet, the market rebounded in March. The pessimistic attitude disappeared. Each sector started to inquire about the lowest price actively. Thus, prices this week basically remained the same. This week, prices of some products still decreased. The main reason is the purchasing price between the supply chain and market: sellers received considerable orders through sacrificing profits in order to raise market share or lower inventory level.
Polysilicon
Because the marketing channels of small and medium-sized polysilicon manufacturers are limited, they focused on lowering their inventory level. Thus, some manufacturers accepted the demand from downstream. Polysilicon prices declined slightly. Yet, the tier-one manufacturers still can maintain the prices. This week, the material price for mono-si was RMB 123-126/kg. The material price for second-tier multi-si was RMB 105-110/kg. The material price for first-tier multi-si was RMB 113-117/kg.
Si-wafer
The leading manufacturers of multi-si wafer have decreased the prices slightly this week, bringing price reduction pressure to other small and medium-sized multi-si wafer manufacturers. For mono-si, because of the increasing demand from downstream, there was no sign of price reduction temporarily. Therefore, the spread between mono-si and multi-si wafer slightly increased to RMB 0.85/pc.
PV cell
This week, PV cell price stayed still. With the small decrease of multi-si wafer price, multi-si PV cell prices from Taiwanese manufacturers slightly dropped to USD 0.18-0.181/W; in terms of mono-si product, owing to rising demand, the price remained the same.
Module
Although there was no obvious action on end market, due to expected booming market, price still became stable. This week, multi-si module price was RMB 2.5-2.57/W and mono-si module price was RMB 2.57-2.62/W.
The result of the bid price for China’s 2017 Top Runner Program has been released. At RMB 0.39-0.45/kWh, the price has brought pressure to module sector. To pursue lower bid price, double power generation product proportion is expected to increase significantly on the next bid.

The 630 installation rush of Chinese market started to stimulate the restocking demands from some dealers. Yet, owing to the different adjustments and releases of capacity for each sector on the supply chain and the unseen end demand, price trends turned out to be inconsistent.
Polysilicon
Due to the completion of inventory digestion for polysilicon and the limitation in supply during the overhaul in April, suppliers started to reduce the supply of low priced products. Some manufacturers even increased their quotes this week in order to reflect the short supply. The hike mainly occurred in the polysilicon price for mono-si and affected the price for multi-si. Though the polysilicon quote for multi-si didn’t rise, the entire average strike price went up slightly. Currently, there is no product with prices at RMB115/kg or lower than RMB 110/kg on the market. However, because the end market hasn’t officially generated demand, currently there is no instant purchasing pressure in the downstream. Observations will be required to see whether the strike prices can be increased generally.
Si-wafer
This week, the average price of multi-si wafer decreased slightly. The main reason was that the cheaper prices were offered to the clients who purchased in larger quantities in order to control inventory. Because it was close to the current purchasing price of PV cell dealers after price reduction, the trading volume also increased. In the short term, price will be RMB 3.6-3.8/pc and above USD 0.5/pc. However, because the downstream market has been testing the bottom line of price, there will be chances for mono-si and multi-si wafer manufacturers to lower the quotes in April in order to meet the demand on the market. It mainly depends on the competitive strategy of each manufacturer.
PV cell
Though currently there is demand on Chinese market, it isn’t strong enough to drive vertically integrated manufacturers to massively purchase PV cells. Thus, the current PV cell demand is still weak. Price in this week slightly dropped. After Taiwanese manufacturers’ multi-si PV cell prices decreased below USD 0.18/W, they declined directly to the price level of Chinese manufacturers, making mono-si and mono-si PERC PV cell prices go down simultaneously in order to maintain the reasonable spread with multi-si PV cell.
Module
China’s 630 installation rush demand is expected to be generated in April. Currently, module manufacturers don’t have the rigid demand, and prices haven’t reached a consensus. Therefore, for general PV cell, there is space for price reduction. Quote slightly decreased. Demand for high-efficiency products was stronger, so high-efficiency module price became more stable.
Recently, a lot of bid results have been released in China. The lower bid price also drove dealers to actively advance their technologies in order to meet the demands for module price on June 30 and by the end of 2018. Technologies with higher price–performance ratio such as half-cut and double-sided modules are expected to be fully adopted among the entire industry after June 30.

This week, price trend became stable. Both polysilicon and PV cell quotes bounced back; owing to inventory digestion and market share competition for mono-si and multi-si wafer manufacturers, si-wafer price slightly declined. Yet, it is expected to be the last decrease before June 30. With the approach of demand for the 630 installation rush, the entire supply chain bounced back starting from the tier-one companies.
Polysilicon
Under the effect of short supply of polysilicon for mono-si, polysilicon quote this week increased. Only a few manufacturers had materials priced below RMB 120/kg. The main price was RMB 120-125/kg. The quote of polysilicon for mono-si reached RMB 130/kg. Because downstream si-wafer price didn’t begin to rise and was still on the stage of inventory digestion and market share competition, the speed of increase for polysilicon price was restricted. Polysilicon price is expected to grow slightly until April. At the end of April, after the end market starts generating demand, the speed will turn faster.
Si-wafer
Multi-si wafer manufacturers are still actively digesting their inventory. The cheaper prices were offered to the clients who purchased in larger quantities. Thus, the entire strike price went down slightly. Yet, with the faster speed of inventory digestion, the possibility of price reduction will drop. In terms of mono-si, although the inventory level was low, price this week slightly dropped in order to compete against multi-si wafer.
Overall, si-wafer price has become stable. The speed of inventory digestion was getting faster. Quote this week is the lowest before June 30 and is expected to continue until the end of April. Afterwards, price will hike along with polysilicon.
PV cell
This week, multi-si PV cell price slightly rebounded. Besides India’s increasing demand after the withdrawal of its anti-dumping petition, the main reason is the demand from Europe and Chinafor high-performance multi-si. The rising demand for high-performance multi-si products on the market obviously increased the demand for black silicon, boosting black silicon development for manufacturers. Black silicon is expected to become the market standard in 3Q18. This week, over 18.6% high-performance multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.37-1.42/W.
Module
Due to the bidding procedure on Chinese market and the rebound of overseas market, module price was steady. Yet, because of the oversupply for the general PV cell, price of low-priced module may drop again.

1. Due to system maintenance, the information of RMB quote on March 28 will not be released until 9 p.m (Taipei/Beijing time). We apologize for the inconvenience.
2. For next Wednesday (April 4), the price quotes will not be released owing to the holidays. It will be announced on April 11.

Besides upstream polysilicon price, which has started to change, prices for the rest of the supply chain remained at the same level this week. However, the market has begun to see stock-up orders, reflected in the atmosphere of inventory digestion. With the second season of high installed capacity, the stock-up activity is set to strengthen, and price movements across the supply chain will continue to rise due to the reduction of inventory levels.
Polysilicon
Under the effect of short supply of polysilicon for mono-si, polysilicon quote this week slightly increased. The main price of compact material was above RMB 120/kg. The average transaction price fell within RMB 122-128/kg. The quote of mono-si material was above RMB 130/kg.
Si-wafer
Currently, multi-si wafer price is flat. The main reason is inventory digestion. Besides, the stock-up activity from the end market hasn’t affected si-wafer section. Thus, there hasn’t been a significant increase in demand. In terms of mono-si wafer, the demand outstripped supply, mainly due to a shortage of inventory. This has also led to the slight increase for a few transaction prices. The quote in the end of the month may affect the change of prices for mono-si and multi-si wafer.
PV cell
Multi-si PV cell price increased slightly this week, mainly owing to the dissolution of India’s anti-dumping petition and poverty reduction program in China. The demand for mono-si PV cell remained stable for overseas markets such as Europe, Australia and China. Besides, because the market demand hasn’t been fully activated, the entire price became flat or decreased slightly.
Module
The module inventories in Chinese market started to fall, especially for low-efficiency modules used in poverty reduction programs. Smaller plants are returning to normal production operations. The current module price tends to stabilize. Once the inventory level is insufficient, the overall supply and demand situation will change.

                                Cobalt Prices Soared by More Than 20% in 1Q18, Bringing More Price Pressure to Lithium-ion Batteries                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20180412-12261.html,"

According to the latest data from EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, cobalt prices continued to rise in 2018 and soared by more than 20% in the first quarter. The rise of raw material prices results from short-term capital speculation and high supplier concentration. This concentrated industry structure may continue to push up the prices in long term. The soaring costs of raw material will be reflected in prices of lithium batteries and new energy vehicles quarter by quarter. This is also a challenge for the battery industry, which has been figuring out ways to reduce the dependence on cobalt.
According to Duff Lu, senior research manager of EnergyTrend, the price of cobalt has been a focus of market. The use of cobalt provides battery makers with the easiest way to increase energy density before the new generation materials become matured. The price of cobalt metal hits new highs, from US$32/kg in early 2017 to US$75/kg at the year end, an annual growth of 114%. In 1Q18, the price went up by another 26% quarterly, reaching US$95/kg. The soaring price will bring more challenges to the development of new energy vehicle industry.
""The change in cobalt metal prices is mainly influenced by short-term speculation in the market"", says Lu. The prices are mainly decided by the supply side rather than based on supply and demand. In addition, many second-tier makers of battery cells and battery anode material have been hit hard by the fluctuation of raw material prices. Their cost in raw material purchase turned out to be higher than that of the first-tier manufacturers. Battery system makers and branded makers also rely on first-tier manufacturers for cost considerations, resulting in less diversified supply and less healthy competition in the market.
However, in the battery cells of IT products, the proportion of cobalt is less than 5%, therefore the prices of cobalt will have limited impact on consumer electronics.
To reduce cost pressure, battery makers are expected to lower the percentage of cobalt in current NMC batteries
Lu says that battery system makers and branded makers will accelerate the development of new generation material and alternatives to reduce the restriction brought by raw materials. In addition to developing products with high ratio of nickel, battery makers will also accelerate the mass production of lithium-ion batteries that use silicon oxide as cathode materials.
The two approaches above mainly focus on increasing energy density, while another solution based on blended polymer can effectively reduce costs. In the blended polymer solution, NMC and LCO are blended in the anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Although the energy density is lowered by approximately 20%, this will still be the direction of development for companies due to the low costs. Major battery cell suppliers like Samsung SDI, LG Chem, and Lishen have all proposed blended polymer solutions in which the portion of NMC is higher than 20%. However, swelling of the cell remains a problem for the application of NMC materials in polymer batteries. Therefore, the industry has not yet accumulated complete R&D experience. There will be a chance to see a small amount of blended polymer batteries in the market in the second half of 2018. However, if the cobalt price declines rapidly in the future, it will need further observation to find out whether the development of blended polymer solutions is valuable for the market.

                                Upstream Is in Short Supply, While Downstream Undergoes Inventory Digestion: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20180419-12268.html,"









The phenomenon of market demand has fermented, with the momentum originally expected to reflect only demand from the major or first-tier plants beginning to extend to second- and third-tier plants. For midstream and downstream cell modules, this week's continuation of last week's destocking has kept the industry on the lookout for the best purchase timing. Next week is expected to see a new quote for si-wafer, so the industry remained flat this week.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon prices remained bullish this week due to a shortage of polysilicon supplies, continuing last week's full order until the next month. However, while there is a trend toward higher prices, this is not yet reflected in the actual transaction prices, which is related to the actual situation of material supply. This week's trading was affected by the fact that the polysilicon plants no longer released long term orders, so the change was small. Afterward, it will depend on the variety of the demand of the entire industry chain. The new si-wafer quote next week will definitely affect the price fluctuation of the entire industry chain.
Si-wafer
As next week comes the time to provide new quotes of each month, most downstream manufacturers held a wait-and-see attitude this week, with few orders, even if it was a temporary emergency. Multi-si wafer continued to digest inventory, and the demand momentum has not yet been increased. Mono-si wafer demand continued to rise. Some small and medium-sized manufacturers have searched for si-wafer source. Currently, there is an expectation that the quotes at the end of the month may be adjusted. Some downstream manufacturers began to assess the intention of signing the long term orders.
PV cell
The first-tier mono-si PV cell manufacturers, which mainly supply the overseas market, have put production into the established process, and the market demand of high-performance PERC products was relatively sufficient. The price of partial orders rose slightly, but it has not yet reached the stage of full growth. It is expected to be related to the stock level and the flat price of si-wafer sector.
Multi-si PV cell and mono-si PV cell had a similar phenomenon. The market for high-performance product demand was far more than the standard multi-si, so the current demand for standard multi-si is waiting to be formed by China and India market.
Module
The overall market for modules was relatively unchanged, and the original inventory level continued to drop. The speed of module destocking will gradually increase with the arrival of the peak season for power station installation in the second quarter. The price of modules remained flat. Unlike the high-performance models whose prices can still be maintained to stop the decline, the standard models may have room for price negotiation. It is estimated that with the entire capacity and inventory digestion in May, the change of supply and demand conditions will lead to a positive price situation.

This week, manufacturers from the upstream and downstream still adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the market. Although each sector had a new quote, the actual transaction number was low. The reason for this is that there was still room to wait for the next trading opportunity. Besides, neither the buyers nor suppliers have reached an official pricing agreement. As the PV cell industry’s manufacturers are still anticipating the new monthly price quotes for si-wafers, the next wave of price growth could come from this segment.
Polysilicon
Due to the continued shortage of mono-si material for polysilicon, the supply was unable to meet the demand, and the orders in May have occupied more than half of the production capacity. China's domestic manufacturers maintained flat prices, which were around RMB130-135/Kg. Prices of foreign manufacturers were driven by the demand on the Chinese market. The lowest price has exceeded US$14/Kg. In terms of multi-si material, because the supply was sufficient and some manufacturers increased the capacity utilization, the price was RMB 121-125/Kg. The short-term polysilicon prices are expected to rise. Owing to the change of price and supply, mono-si and multi-si materials will be different.
Si-wafer
This week was the routine quote week on a monthly basis for major si-wafer manufacturers. In terms of mono-si wafer, because the capacity of the first-tier manufacturers was full, the uncertainty of upstream polysilicon supply became higher; the price is expected to remain or increase slightly. The rate of inventory digestion for multi-si wafer was out of expectation, as the speeds of supply and consumption couldn’t reach a balance, making the entire demand momentum become sluggish. Another reason is that the downstream PV cell manufacturers were still at the stage of inventory digestion; their urgency of purchasing material was less apparent than mono-si, so some transaction prices were lower than the market prices. It is estimated that if there is no further market demand, the multi-si wafer price trend will turn to a different situation unlike mono-si.
PV cell
Demand for mono-si PV cells was on the rise this week. In addition to the existing demand for high-performance products in overseas Europe, the local demand in China increased and focused on high-performance PERC products at the same time, causing full capacity of the first-tier companies that focused on mono-si PERC products. The overall demand was greater than the supply.
Multi-si PV cells showed another trend, limited by the unexpected stock-up activity on the Indian market and the large output of general or inefficient products, which made the sales for this type of product become sluggish. Some manufacturers tried to introduce black silicon and PERC technology to improve efficiency, hoping to gain more orders. However, owing to the limited order released by the market for such products, it is expected to be in oversupply afterward.
Module
The module market continued the destocking situation of last week, and the originally anticipated peak season has not yet reached the peak demand. Only high-performance mono-si products stood out in the market. In addition to the price increase for some high-performance mono-si modules, the prices of other modules remained flat. The bargaining space for general conventional products was small. For individual orders, they may remain or drop slightly. The demand will need 1-2 weeks to be improved.

This week, China is supposed to step into the start-up stage of the 630 installation rush. The PV cell and module manufacturers should start stocking up. Yet, the actual condition failed to meet expectations. Besides Labor Day holiday, the imbalance between supply and demand for polysilicon and si-wafer last week is a reason. The expected demand is likely to be postponed. Other factors should be observed.
Polysilicon
Most of this month's polysilicon orders were completed last month, so prices have not changed much this week and mono-si or multi-si material mainly remained flat. Prices of mono-si material were still around RMB 130/Kg and prices of multi-si material were around RMB 123/Kg. Because of the price reduction for mono-si wafer leading manufacturers last week, afterward, its effect on supply and demand should be observed.
Si-wafer
Quotes of mono-si wafer leading manufacturers were RMB 4.55/W (China) and US$0.61/W (overseas), with a slight decrease. For multi-si wafer, the existing price gap was maintained to boost downstream purchasing demand. Yet, the entire market condition this week didn't warm up. The next wave of price growth hasn't showed up. New incentives will need to be expected.
PV cell
This week's demand for PV cells continued to reflect last week's market conditions: market demands for mono-si and multi-si PV cells gradually showed two situations. Affected by existing overseas orders and Chinese demand, mono-si PERC products have been warming up since April, but it hasn't reached the stage of imbalance between supply and demand. The demand is expected to extend to the beginning of the third quarter.
The demand for multi-si PV cells has been calm, with most of them on standby, except for some small and medium-sized manufacturers, who expected si-wafers to continue to fall in price. First-tier manufacturers were continuing to increase production utilization at an economic scale to reduce total production costs, and were even aggressively developing technologies that can improve product performance, facing market uncertainty with technological diversity. Prices this week didn't change much.
Module
The change of module market was similar to PV cell market. The demand for high-efficiency mono-si PERC products was strong, but the actual deal price didn't change much. First-tier PV cell manufacturers continued to supply high-efficiency products. The imbalance between supply and demand hasn't been observed.
Multi-si module had the same situation. The supply of the first-tier manufacturers became the focus. To handle the change on the market, small and medium-sized manufacturers became conservative. If there is no other trigger, the entire market condition is expected to be sluggish.

                                Mono-Si and Multi-Si Market Conditions Become Different, with Booming Growth for the Former and Sluggish Performance for the Latter: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20180510-12292.html,"









The 630 installation rush hasn’t completely started. Yet, mono-si and multi-si supply chains were different. Upstream polysilicon has entered the peak season and the entire supply and demand became balanced; for midstream si-wafer, because the price competition between mono-si and multi-si products has changed, and because demand has become the focus of the industry, the development trends of mono-si and multi-si were different. Under the impact of unstable supply of si-wafer, multi-si PV cell’s momentum can only drive a small number of first-tier manufacturers who have room for price reduction. For the second- and third-tier manufacturers who can’t lower their prices, they took conservative actions and their spaces to survive may be squeezed.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon orders in May have been extended to June. In addition, the manufacturers, who were under overhaul previously, restarted production. In 1H18, the capacity expansion has been achieved. (The top three manufacturers in April were: Zhongneng, TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis and DAQO, who cover almost half of the capacity). In the future, with the balance between supply and demand, prices will go up steadily.
Price for mono-si material was around RMB 130-133/Kg. Price for multi-si material was around RMB 126-128/Kg. Owing to the stable supply, in the future, the price change for polysilicon will depend on the individual demand for mono-si and multi-si material.
Si-wafer
Price of mono-si wafer remained unchanged. Yet, the actual demand largely increased, especially for high-quality mono-si wafer. The first-tier mono-si manufacturers have reached full capacity in order to meet the demand on the market.
Multi-si wafer became sluggish. For second- and third-tier manufacturers who can’t lower their prices, they reduced the capacity, resulting in the appearance of RMB 3.3/W on the market. Yet, because the trade was quite sluggish, the reasonable transaction price was RMB 3.4-3.45/W. If this condition continues, there may be a new wave of mergers in si-wafer sector.
PV cell
Because the demand of mono-si PV cell grew, the production of high efficiency mono-si PV cell and general mono-si PV cell in China remained steady. The rise of utilization also helped decrease the cost, further increasing the demand on end market and making high efficiency mono-si PV cell gain the highest profits. Price in China reached RMB 1.6/W, and overseas price hit US$0.23/W.
Because Chinese market condition changed and the demand for modules below 270W fell, the overseas orders changed to focus on other products, making the demand for multi-si PV cell become weak. The middle and small-sized manufacturers, who can’t increase the capacity, had to stop production.
Module
The demand of high efficiency mono-si PERC product was strong. Some transaction prices even surpassed RMB 2.7/W. The condition of multi-si module was similar to multi-si PV cell. The focus was the supply of first-tier manufacturers. Due to the pressure from market competition, the middle and small-sized manufacturers only had to take conservative actions. Some manufacturers only had to reduce prices, hoping to lower the cost or exit safely. Because of the continuous supply for the first-tier manufacturers, with the market condition of weak multi-si, the spaces for the middle and small-sized manufacturers to survive may be squeezed.

This week, the market demand was still weak. The 630 installation rush didn’t go as expected, which may be related to the wait-and-see attitude on the market caused by government’s policy. Due to low demand and the gap between supply and price, the supply chain market status of mono-si and multi-si products differed. Polysilicon reached the peak season and the supply became balanced. Yet, owing to low demand, the price of polysilicon material became unstable. In the sectors such as si-wafer, PV cell and module, mono-si and multi-si became quite different. The production costs of mono-si and multi-si modules were the same, but high efficiency products were more popular on the market, resulting in the high demand of mono-si. However, multi-si was forced to reduce production.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon price remained stable. Chinese mono-si material price remained above RMB 130/Kg. Polysilicon material price was RMB 122-127/Kg.
With the planned expansion of production in the first half of the year, the increased supply of polysilicon material is expected to create new bargaining space. Some clients even hope to re-negotiate with suppliers who have previously completed order transactions, but this will not be successful. In the future, price changes of polysilicon are likely to change according to the demand of individual order. Polysilicon material will be more affected.
Si-wafer
Because the demand of mono-si remained strong enough to support the price, this week, mono-si wafer price became stable. The status of multi-si wafer was sluggish. The percentage of second-tier and third-tier manufacturers selling or reducing production increased, causing the appearance of RMB 3.1/pc on the market and even indirectly affecting the target price of first-tier multi-si wafer manufacturers to RMB 3.3/pc.
Price of mono-si wafer was RMB 4.45-4.5/pc, and the reasonable trading price of multi-si wafer should fall in the range of RMB 3.45-3.85 /pc. However, the trend of mono-si and multi-si wafer was affected by the drop of market condition, causing their prices to move in different directions.
PV cell
This week, PV cell price trend basically followed si-wafer: mono-si price remained unchanged and multi-si price was lowered due to the pressure from first-tier manufacturers. There were even cells priced at RMB 5.5/pc (around RMB 1.22/W) for some small manufacturers. Yet, the potential for a transaction was low.
The demand for multi-si products in China was low. With higher price–performance ratio and demand, the increase of capacity utilization has contributed to the overall cost reduction for high efficiency mono-si products, creating a positive cycle and bringing the highest profits for high efficiency mono-si products. High efficiency mono-si PV cell price was above RMB 1.62/W and the general mono-si price was RMB 1.48/W; high efficiency multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.33-1.55/W.
Module
This week, the module market hasn’t changed much. The price trend and demand followed the changes of si-wafer and PV cell. The demand for high efficiency mono-si PERC module was steady. Multi-si module maintained last week’s condition: manufacturers that cannot resist price pressures have begun to sell at lower prices. Owing to the low demand of multi-si in China, the supply chain faced greater difficulty recently. Compared with over RMB 2.6/W for mono-si module and RMB 2.7/W for high efficiency products, multi-si module price was around RMB 2.5/W.

                                With SNEC 2018 Shanghai Approaching, Multi-si Market Expects High Demand: Price Trend                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20180524-12312.html,"









As the PV industry’s annual event, SNEC 2018 Shanghai, will be held next week, manufacturers are likely to expect new sparks during the show, leading to little surprises and changes in market conditions this week. Polysilicon in China was dominated by the execution of established contracts, with few new deals; in the si-wafer market, mono si and multi si products are still experiencing different developments. Although the mono-si demand in China was a little unstable, the phenomenon should be temporary. PV cells, as before, showed different trends in the mono-si and multi-si segments. The demand for high efficiency products with higher price–performance ratio was stable. In terms of module, whether it is the mono-si or multi-si products, the developments have remained unchanged, reflecting the wait-and-see attitude in the downstream power station market. Manufacturers are expecting that there will be new issues at the exhibition next week.
Polysilicon
The deals this week mainly came from previous orders. Chinese mono-si material price was still stable at RMB 131-133/Kg. The momentum of downstream manufacturers of multi-si material disappeared. Yet, because manufacturers have begun to reduce production and the amount of tradable polysilicon has been reduced, the market price still maintained the level of RMB 122-125/Kg. Afterwards, mono-si material is expected to maintain a balance between supply and demand. However, multi-si material price is likely to be unsteady due to unstable downstream demand.
Si-wafer
Multi-si wafer price in China this week continued to drop and approached RMB 3.1/pc; prices from first-tier manufacturers remained at RMB 3.2/pc and they tackled the problem of the decrease in price by reducing production. The market expects that multi-si wafer price can maintain RMB 3.0/pc before June 30, but according to the current market status, there will be uncertainty.
The price reduction of multi-si wafer affected mono-si wafer. Even though the demand of mono-si wafer was strong, the price started to become unstable. Mono-si wafer price slightly decreased to RMB 4.30-4.45/pc, while multi-si wafer was RMB 3.10-3.20/pc. The spread was RMB 1.2-1.25/pc, which has surpassed the reasonable figure.
PV cell
This week, the trend of PV cell prices roughly followed the si-wafer market movements. Yet, the mono-si PV cell price in China lowered slightly in order to reflect the market atmosphere. In terms of multi-si PV cell, whether it is high efficiency or general efficiency products, the prices dropped continuously. If multi-si PV cell manufacturers don’t have other supporting measures, they are likely to lose a lot of money. High efficiency mono-si PV cell price remained above RMB 1.62/W. General mono-si PV cell price was RMB 1.48/W. Multi-si PV cell price was RMB 1.30-1.35/W.
Module
This week, because most manufacturers held wait-and-see attitude and hoped SNEC could bring new change for the market, there was no huge change on the module sector. Currently, mono-si module price can reach above RMB 2.6/W and high efficiency product price slightly declines to RMB 2.65/W compared with last week; multi-si module price is RMB 2.35-2.4/W.

The conclusion of the annual SNEC 2018 event in Shanghai showed that the mass production of new technologies and products is expected to enter the official implementation phase, but there is still a lack of support in terms of supply chain prices, especially multi-si supply chain prices, which continued to decline. Mono-si wafer leading manufacturers announced a reduction in prices on May 25 and were significantly affected by the recent trend of decrease in the price of multi-siproducts. Next, price reduction pressure will further affect the upstream polysilicon and cause price instability; due to unexpected demand intensity, the future price trend of multi-si PV cell and module won’t be optimistic.
Polysilicon
Not many new deals have been generated this week. The deals mainly came from previous orders. Some manufacturers of multi-si material have started to cut or even discontinue production, and both mono-si and multi-si manufacturers are considering conducting the annual overhaul in advance, with the current expected off-season demand. So far, the overall price for mono-si material has come to around RMB 120/Kg, and multi-si material price has decreased to around RMB 105/Kg. In addition, the weak demand of multi-si products for downstream market has affected the balance between supply and demand of multi-si material; in contrast, benefiting from the demand driven by 630 installation rush, mono-si material didn’t have any price reduction problem for the time being. However, if multi-si material price continues to fall, it is estimated to affect mono-si material price in July.
Si-wafer
Affected by the continuous decline in multi-si wafer prices, the first-tier manufacturers of mono-si wafer have slightly reduced their price, respectively, to RMB 4.2/Pc in China and US$0.58/Pc overseas. In terms of multi-si wafer, some first-tier manufacturers have started to reduce production in order to lower inventory. Some small- and medium-sized manufacturers underwent operational difficulties and they sold in low prices. The overall price is still in decline, and the decline even intensified. So far, multi-si wafer price has been on the verge of breaking below RMB 3.0/Pc. The price difference between mono-si and multi-si wafer came to RMB 1.2/Pc; China’s overseas prices have also reached around US$0.42/Pc. They will continue to decrease in the coming weeks.
PV cell
This week, PV cell price showed two different trends. With the arrival of China’s domestic 630 installation rush, the demand of mono-si products on the market is heating, and the upstream mono-si wafer is slightly in short supply. Whether it is high efficiency or general efficiency products, the prices increased. The domestic price in China fell within RMB 1.54-1.60/W, while overseas price reached US$0.206-0.235/W. This week, multi-si PV cell price has not changed much and the market still showed a wait-and-see attitude. Chinese and overseas prices came to RMB 1.32/W and US$0.175/W respectively. In the future, multi-si PV cell price is expected to drop continuously.
Module
Multi-si module price was flat this week, mainly due to the continued strong atmosphere of manufacturers watching; prices in China and abroad were within the range of RMB 2.4-2.48/W and US$0.34-0.35/W, respectively. Mono-si module price was linked with upstream PV cell price. Due to the due date of June 30, there was demand momentum for high efficiency or general efficiency mono-si modules on the market. China’s domestic price rose to RMB 2.6-2.65/W. Overseas price reached US$0.38-0.41/W. The momentum is expected to remain above two or three weeks.

After the annual SNEC 2018 event, a new photovoltaic policy released by three Chinese government ministries (the Ministry of Finance, the Bureau of Energy, and the National Development and Reform Commission) has caused a great shock on the market. Thus, the market’s transactions were more stagnant, with lower actual turnover. There was a large gap between the quote and spot price on the market. In the long term, the industrial chain is expected to rectify the unhealthy enterprises, and the competitive high-quality enterprises are expected to continue.
Polysilicon
This week was still dominated by the delivery of existing orders, but because the new policy is expected to drive the third quarter into the off-season, polysilicon manufacturers have begun planning annual overhaul, including Jiangsu Zhongneng (June), SINOSICO (July), TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis, Yongxiang (August) and Daqo (September), hoping to get through the toughest time of the year. As there weren’t too many new deals, the overall market price remained flat or decreased slightly.
Si-wafer
This week, the price of multi-si wafer was relatively unchanged due to the small number of transactions, showing a market-free situation. Mono-si wafer generally maintained supply and demand stability, which is expected to continue until the week before June 30. The momentum in the second half of the month is expected to cause a wave of small surge.
In terms of multi-si, although things above the surface were as calm as water, things beneath the surface were unpredictable and complicated. Multi-si wafer leading plants can lower inventory by reducing production to decrease losses, but trade agents or small manufacturers can only reduce losses through the sale of goods, resulting in the competition of cutting prices. If demand in the market remains plain, with this week’s new policy, the situation for the market’s multi-si could get much worse in the second half.
PV cell
Prices for PV cells and modules remained steady this week. With the demand of 630 installation rush this month and Top Runner Program in the second half of the year, the follow-up demand for high efficiency products is expected to remain stable.
In terms of multi-si products, large manufacturers that have market channels were able to maintain production in order to deliver orders. However, with the sluggish trading in the first half and the policy shock this week, there may be limited room for the development of multi-si product line in the second half of the year. At present, multi-si products don’t have a market. The quotes are for reference only, not the actual transaction prices.
Module
The industry is currently on the sidelines of the overall market development, so this week the module market was dominated by orders to execute 630 demand. After the release of the new policy, it can be observed that the downstream’s system factories have been adjusting their orders’ delivery schedules and will only stock up when necessary. On one hand, doing so would allow them to avoid buying at high prices. On the other hand, it would allow module manufacturers to suffer less inventory pressure, leading to cost reduction. This wait-and-see atmosphere is expected to last until June 30.

After the release of China’s “531” new policies, the industry faced a lot of difficulties. The pressures faced by dealers have become higher. Although enterprises jointly voiced their concerns, the country’s instruction to the development trend of solar energy industry still couldn’t be reversed. The status of the industry this month was weak. Besides the low season of Q3, the “ice age” of the solar energy industry is just around the corner.
Polysilicon
This week, there were many sales in the polysilicon market. A lot of manufacturers were willing to sell at cost price as the bottom line, but the trading willingness on the downstream was still quite weak. On the market, there was RMB 80/kg of multi-si material from small manufacturers, but the transaction volume wasn’t large. The main transaction price was still above RMB 85/kg. China’s transaction price of mono-si material could still be maintained at above RMB 115/kg. Yet, the price of multi-si material ranges from RMB 85-110/kg, which is quite volatile.
The overseas multi-si material should be focusing on long term orders, and the change of price should be small. However, due to the impact of price comparison effect in China, some temporary orders followed, causing the fluctuation of quoted price. So far, there has been overseas manufacturer only offering quoted price of mono-si material. In terms of multi-si material, the quoted price has adopted a conservative attitude toward the market status.
Si-wafer
This week, only the first-tier manufacturers of mono-si wafer could maintain the stability of supply, demand and price. Prices of second- and third-tier manufacturers have started to loosen. Overall, mono-si wafer price hasn’t been influenced. Yet, owing to the epilogue of 630 installation rush and the upcoming low season of Q3, there will be more manufacturers beginning to sell with lower prices in the coming weeks.
Multi-si wafer price continued to decline in the face of weak demand. The inventory level of leading manufacturers has surpassed 300 million; even though the reduction of more than 50% will take a lot of time to lower inventory, the low season will further slow down the pace of inventory destocking. Currently, the prices of the first-tier manufacturers are RMB 2.40-2.55/Pc, followed by an estimate of RMB 2.3/Pc, which is an acceptable bottom line.
PV cell
This week, because of the unstable market status, the price of high-efficiency PV cell became loose. Even though some demands of high-efficiency products are expected to appear in Q3 and Q4, the change of policy still resulted in the instability on the market.
The price of multi-si PV cell dropped due to weak demand. There was a standoff between supply and demand with positive offers from sellers but continued wait-and-see from buyers. If there is no urgency to purchase, such an atmosphere will become a buyer’s market. On the other hand, general mono-si PV cell price remained at RMB 1.50/W, and general multi-si PV cell price has fallen below RMB 1.0/W.
With the end of 630 demand, upstream will gradually cut production to control the level of inventory, and some PV cell plants are expected to start planning to reduce or stop the production.
Module
This week the module market was close to last week to deliver the existing orders, and the new orders were very few, and the main reason was that the new policy caused high uncertainty to subsequent orders. Many system vendors changed the transaction volume or trading time. The lowest price of the general multi-si module has reached RMB 2.00/W. The general mono-si module price has been RMB 2.60/W. The price of high-efficiency multi-si module was roughly flat, mainly because of the small transaction volume.

The solar market has calmed down to some extent after experiencing turmoil related to the new FiT scheme and policy changes that the Chinese government announced two weeks ago on 31 May. China’s PV industry will be entering a period of respite in 3Q18, and individual solar companies will be using this period to devise their next moves and wait for an opportune moment to expand again in the future.
Polysilicon
The overall trading volume has declined this week as suppliers begin to scale back production and proceed with the maintenance of their production plants. However, spot trading prices continue to drop. Currently, the spot prices of multi-Si polysilicon in China are in the range of RMB 75-95/kg, while the spot prices of mono-Si polysilicon are in the range of RMB 100-115/kg. The difference between multi-Si and mono-Si polysilicon is still around RMB 20/kg. Outside China, polysilicon is traded per long-term contract, and the overall volume traded in the latest transactions is quite small. Therefore, there has been no noticeable changes in prices of polysilicon in the overseas markets.
Wafers                                  
First-tier mono-Si wafer suppliers unexpectedly lowered their prices significantly last week and caused a stir in the market. While prices of mono-Si wafers have been on a slide, first-tier multi-Si wafer suppliers have been cutting production and getting rid of excess inventory. Hence, the expectation of a large drop in multi-Si wafer prices is not as strong as before. Furthermore, some vertically integrated manufacturers have begun seeking quotations for multi-Si wafers in the recent period. This indicates the possibility of a turnaround in the supply chain for multi-Si products.
Currently, prices of mono-Si and multi-Si wafers are around RMB 3.65-3.75/pc and RMB 2.3-2.5/pc, respectively. Outside China, prices of mono-Si and multi-Si wafers are holding on at US$0.5/pc and US$ 0.3/pc, respectively.
Cells
Prices of mono-Si cells have corrected downward substantially this week in response to the decline in wafer prices. Prices of mono-Si cells in China are around RMB 1.32-1.40/W, while prices high-efficiency mono-Si cells are around RMB 1.40-1.45/W.
As for multi-Si cells, there are still instances where they are priced according to piece rather than watt in order to drive sales. Prices of standard multi-Si cells have come to RMB 4.1-4.2/pc, which is equivalent to about RMB 0.92/W. Prices of high-efficiency cells featuring black silicon are RMB 0.98/W on average. There are reports of major solar companies seeking quotations for multi-Si cell orders this week, so a significant amount of demand may be injected into this market in the near future.
Modules
Transactions in the module market are scant this week, reflecting the subsiding of demand in China just before 30 June. Chinese suppliers are now either scaling back or suspending production in preparation for the slow season. Prices of standard multi-Si modules are still around RMB 2.0-2.2/W. As for standard mono-Si modules, their prices are also maintained at the level of RMB 2.55/W, despite falling prices in the upstream. Compared with China, the overseas markets are more active. Module quotes in India have generally come to US$0.25-0.27/W. However, prices of actual transactions may go up to US$0.27-0.30/W if modules are shipped from third-party countries that are unaffected by trade barriers.

The market is about to enter the third quarter of recuperation. All manufacturers have to come up with a solution to maintain their operations. The first-tier manufacturers have relied on the advantage of integrated resources from the upstream and downstream segments of the supply chain, and the new policy won’t significantly affect their supply and demand. Faced with the pressure of survival, the smaller manufacturers are selling their products aggressively at the expense of profits. Some manufacturers who couldn’t make it under the industry’s new policy will have to rely on stronger companies such as first-tier integrated manufacturers to stabilize the development of the industry.
Polysilicon
This week, the capacity of polysilicon has been affected due to routine maintenance, yet, the price of multi-si material still decreased to RMB 75-90/KG. The primary goal of first-tier manufacturers is to stabilize the actual transaction price at RMB 80/KG. The price of mono-si material dropped to RMB 90-110/KG. The difference between multi-si and mono-si polysilicon was still around RMB 20/KG. In terms of overseas material, polysilicon was traded per long-term contract at US$13.5/KG, and the price of short-term orders didn’t change much.
Si-wafer
The leading manufacturers of mono-si wafer lowered their quote prices this week, boosting the decrease of spot price of mono-si wafer in China to RMB 3.26-3.45/pc and US$0.445-0.495/pc for overseas price. On the other hand, first-tier manufacturers of multi-si wafer reduced operating rate and inventory. Besides, with the appearance of module trading from downstream, the previous decreasing trend of multi-si wafer was stabilized. Chinese domestic and overseas prices remained at RMB 2.3-2.45/Pc and US$0.34/pc respectively.
PV cell
This week, mono-si PV cell price dropped largely owing to the decrease of si-wafer price. Price of general mono-si PV cell decreased to RMB 1.2-1.25/W and RMB 1.35-1.43/W for high-efficiency mono-si. In terms of multi-si, because of the large number of orders, the price of regular PV cell remained at RMB 0.90-1.02/W; overseas price dropped to US$0.133-0.140/W.
Module
This week, the module market showed signs of retreating. The general multi-si module price fell within RMB 1.80-2.20/W. The main demand came from markets other than China. So far, general mono-si module has not yet reflected the upstream price reduction, thus, the price was RMB 2.50-2.60/W.

This week, prices of sectors presented mixed results. The upstream polysilicon companies kept their prices from dropping too much through proper overhaul and inventory reduction. The decrease in price for multi-si wafer last week resulted in the decline of downstream PV cell and module prices. Yet, due to overseas orders and the orders from vertically integrated manufacturers, prices of some sectors even increased slightly. In the future, the market is expected to witness two extreme conditions: stable supply and demand for well-developed companies and constant sell-off for the weak ones.
Polysilicon
This week, there have been benefits of reducing capacity on the polysilicon market: the first-tier manufacturers monitored the supply effectively in order to raise prices on the proper time; for the second- and third-tier manufacturers or even traders, they have increased RMB 2-3/KG. The price of multi-si material this week remained at RMB 78-90/KG, and the reasonable price range for the first-tier manufacturers was RMB 80-85/KG. The price of mono-si material remained at RMB 90-110/KG. The difference between multi-si and mono-si polysilicon was still around RMB 20/KG.

Owing to the decrease of stock level of multi-si wafer in China and module orders, multi-si wafer price this week can remain at RMB 2.35-2.5/Pc. In terms of mono-si wafer, the price was RMB 3.26-3.45/Pc. Overseas prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer were the same, which were US$0.445-0.495/Pcand US$0.32-0.35/Pc, respectively. Overall, si-wafer price this week was unchanged.
PV cell
This week, mono-si PV cell price declined. Quoted price of the general mono-si PV cell decreased to RMB 1.05-1.15/W. For high-efficiency mono-si, the price experienced a steeper decline and reached RMB 1.2-1.3/W. Overseas prices also dropped. The general mono-si PV cell price fell to US$0.155-0.175/W and high-efficiency mono-si PV cell price shed to US$0.180-0.195/W. In terms of multi-si, because of the large amount of orders, regular PV cell price grew slightly and reached RMB 0.98-1.07/W; overseas price remained at US$0.133-0.14/W.
Module
The module market trend this week was similar to last week. Most of the general multi-si module prices could reach RMB 2/W. The overall price range for multi-si module was around RMB2.0-2.35/W. For mono-si module, due to the price reduction of upstream PV cell, the price declined. So far, the general mono-si module price has decreased to RMB 2.25-2.35/W. High-efficiency mono-si price was RMB2.35-2.50/W with greater decrease. Overseas market didn’t change much, which may be related to the completion of existing orders.

The supply and demand on the market have reached a balance since last week. At this point, it isn’t necessarily beneficial to increase or decrease the capacity. Yet, due to the reappearance of stable orders on the market, the previous expansion plans are likely to be implemented. In terms of the current situation, well-developed companies will have a large business space, and those who have faced various problems will have to wait for the opportunity to retreat.
Polysilicon
In the polysilicon market, many are obviously waiting for the market’s activity to return to normal. As of this week, there were still signs of reduced production and negative transactions. In terms of reduced production, although there were at least 12 manufacturers lowering the production in China and the margin reached nearly 50%, most first-tier manufacturers carried out the expansion plan in order to execute the signed orders. Thus, two extreme conditions were displayed.
So far, the price of multi-si material in China has remained at RMB 77-90/KG. The actual transaction price of first-tier manufacturers was RMB 80-85/KG. The price of mono-si material reached RMB 90-100/KG.
The price reduction on the Chinese market has influenced the overseas dealers. Besides the higher cost of electricity price in the summer, some manufacturers conducted the annual overhaul or lowered the production, with the margin of 50%. Thus, this may also be helpful to slow down the price reduction. So far, overseas mainstream multi-si material price has remained at US$10.0-13.0/KG. The upper limit of the spot transaction price was about US$13.0/KG, and the long-term price could reach the level of US$12.0-12.5/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the si-wafer market basically became stable. Whether mono-si or multi-si, the fluctuation between price, supply and demand was more moderate. The price of multi-si wafer has reached RMB 2.40-2.50/Pc, and the price of mono-si wafer has remained at RMB3.20-3.37/Pc. There was no obvious change for the prices on the overseas market. Prices of mono-si and multi-si have reached US$0.445-0.455/Pc and US$0.32-0.345/Pc, respectively.
PV cell
The demand of mono-si PV cell this week didn’t disappear despite the end of the June 30th deadline. The orders of Chinese first-tier manufacturers were full,and even new orders were thrown out from time to time. The overall price of overseas market dropped. Therefore, the attitude towards new purchase orders is conservative, and it is difficult to increase the transaction price even if there is strong demand.
So far, price of generalmono-si PV cell in China has remained at RMB1.05-1.15/W, and high-efficiency mono-si PV cell price has decreased to RMB 1.20-1.28/W. For multi-si PV cell, there were price increases for major manufacturers and easing of price reduction for minor manufacturers. Price was mainly affected by the orders of first-tier manufacturers. The general multi-si PV cell price has remained at RMB 0.98-1.10/W.
In terms of overseas market, because of fewer factors of disturbance, the existing orders were conducted. So far, the general mono-si PV cell price has been US$0.155-0.160/W, and high-efficiency mono-si PV cell price has slightly shed to US$0.179-0.183/W. Due to the large amount of orders for multi-si PV cell, the price could be stabilized at US$0.133-0.136/W.
Module
Like the PV cell market, the situation in the module market was steady. The price range of multi-si module in China was RMB 1.90-2.35/W. For mono-si module, price fell slightly owing to the slowdown in demand after June 30. The general mono-si module price was in the range of RMB 2.25-2.30/W. The price of high-efficiency mono-si module slightly decreased to RMB 2.35-2.50/W.
Due to prices in Chinese market, mono-si module price in overseas market hit a new low. As a result of technological differences, the general mono-si modules had price gaps, ranging from US$0.29-0.40/W. Price of high-efficiency mono-si module has dropped slightly, by US$0.326-0.410/W. Price of multi-si module didn’t change much, and the range of US$0.260-0.299/W was still maintained.

The inventory control of upstream multi-si wafers has been effective. With international end demand support, si-wafer price fluctuation stabilized this week, affecting upstream polysilicon’s production start-up rate. In terms of downstream PV cells and modules, there were still two extreme conditions for China at home and abroad and large and small factories. Stable overseas demand assisted China’s first-tier integrated manufacturers. The small- and medium-sized factories, which relied on the domestic market in the past, had to depend on OEM orders distributed by these integrated manufacturers.
Polysilicon
This week, there have been different changes in the prices of polysilicon. The production start-up rate of multi-si wafer has increased since last week, making the demand for multi-si material bounce back. However, the first-tier manufacturers still wanted to maintain price stability. Thus, they signed the orders of July at the original price. The rise of downstream production start-up rate made the second-tier manufacturers begin to digest inventory and improve production start-up rate, slightly increasing the low price. So far, China’s multi-si material price has remained at RMB 80-85/KG, and mono-si material price has remained at RMB 90-100/KG.
In terms of productivity reduction, after a 27.7% cut in June, there is expected to be an additional cut of 5% in July, bringing the total to 32.7%, which is equivalent to about 100,000 tons. The number of China’s domestic and overseas manufacturers, which cut production and conducted overhaul, has increased to 14. Overseas multi-si material price didn’t change much. Yet, due to the change of exchange rate, global average price of multi-si material fell slightly.
Si-wafer
The clearing out of multi-si wafer inventory has gone smoothly, and the stock level has reached a new low point in nearly a month, which represented a good balance of supply and demand for manufacturers to control. As there were still some terminal demands, some manufacturers started to raise their equipment utilization rate. There was even a shortage of multi-si demand in the market. First-tier manufacturers tried to take advantage of this, but have not yet succeeded.
So far, multi-si wafer price has reached RMB2.40-2.50/Pc. Manufacturers expected RMB2.45/Pc as the minimum stop loss point. Mono-si wafer price remained unchanged at RMB3.20-3.37/Pc. Overseas prices were also unchanged. Prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer remained at US$0.445-0.455/Pc and US$0.32-0.345/Pc, respectively.
PV cell
This week, PV cell factories adopted a flat-price strategy to deal with the market. The drop of price has stopped temporarily. Yet, the supply structure hasn’t changed. The demand of China’s first-tier manufacturers was supported by overseas orders. However, small- and medium-sized manufacturers could only rely on the OEM orders from the first-tier manufacturers.
So far, price of generalmono-si PV cell in China has remained at RMB1.05-1.15/W, and high-efficiency mono-si PV cell price has remained at RMB1.20-1.28/W. For multi-si PV cell, the general multi-si PV cell price of first-tier manufacturers has reached RMB1.05-1.10/W. Prices of mono-si and multi-si PV cell have started to overlap.
Overseas orders were stable. So far, price of generalmono-si PV cell has slightly decreased to US$0.152-0.160/W. High-efficiency mono-si PV cell price has remained at US$0.179-0.183/W, and multi-si PV cell price has reached US$0.133-0.136/W.
Module
This week, the general multi-si module price could remain flat owing to the demand on the market. The price of 270W module of China’s first-tier manufacturers could achieve RMB2.05-2.10/W. Some quotes of high-efficiency multi-si module followed the general multi-si module, causing price reduction. The price range of multi-si module was RMB1.90-2.35/W.
On the other hand, mono-si market demand slowed down after June 30. In particular, the high-efficiency mono-si module bid of SPIC is expected to lower the price, resulting in RMB2.30-2.40/W of high-efficiency mono-si module price, which will influence the general mono-si module price to drop to RMB2.10-2.30/W.
In terms of overseas market, the price was unchanged.

All parts of the supply chain were flexible this week: buyers of upstream polysilicon material have begun to negotiate prices for follow-up supplies. Besides, the production control of each plant was appropriate, resulting in a slight growth in price. In terms of si-wafer, last week multi-si wafer price performance and the expectation of new price at the end of the month made it hard for mono-si price to increase. The latest prices released by mono-si wafer leading manufacturers have become the new barrier for multi-si products. The market status of downstream PV cell and module might vary from region to region. India’s trade barriers seem to have been all talk and no action. Yet, there has been a high-efficiency module bidding phenomenon in Europe. The impact of its recent MIP decision is worthy of attention.
Polysilicon
China’s domestic polysilicon prices edged higher this week, mainly because of the smooth destocking of polysilicon material. The orders of July were basically signed with the previous original price. Recently, due to the emergence of demand, the number of inquiries has grown. Downstream start-up rate continued to improve. Second-tier manufacturers began to digest inventory, and the start-up rate also increased.
In terms of productivity reduction, there were 12 enterprises conducting overhaul this week. In July, China’s polysilicon production was around 18,000 tons, and it is expected that about 2,000 tons of output will be affected by August. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has reached RMB 80-90/KG, and mono-si material price has maintained the level of RMB 95-105/KG. Overseas multi-si material price hasn’t changed much.
Si-wafer
This week, si-wafer market changed little. So far, mono-si price has reached RMB3.10-3.30/Pc. Multi-si wafer was in a rising atmosphere, and the price was stable at RMB 2.40/Pc. Black silicon product price had a RMB0.3-0.40/Pc price difference. Overseas mono-si wafer price decreased to US$0.395-0.445/Pc, and multi-si price remained at US$0.325-0.370/Pc. The peak was the price of black silicon wafer.
Because mono-si wafer leading manufacturers have announced a price reduction on the 25th, it is expected that there will be new price changes next week. Multi-si wafer may also follow up next week.
PV cell
Because the market demand outside China emerged and the overseas order percentage of multi-si was high, multi-si PV cell price became stable. So far, China’s domestic general and high-efficiency mono-si PV cell prices were RMB1.05-1.15/W and RMB 1.20-1.28/W. First-tier manufacturers’ general multi-si PV cell price reached RMB 1.05-1.10/W. For overseas prices, general mono-si price slightly decreased to US$0.142-0.156/W. High-efficiency mono-si price remained at US$0.177-0.183/W, and multi-si price also could hold firmly in US$0.135-0.158/W.
Module
The 270W module inventory of China’s first-tier manufacturers wasn’t large enough to support the price of RMB 2.05-2.10/W. The price of general mono-si module dropped to RMB 2.10-2.30/W owing to the lack of demand. High-efficiency mono-si price also reduced to RMB 2.30-2.40/W.
In terms of overseas market, 290-295W mono-si module price decreased to US$0.281-0.407/W. Over 300W high-efficiency mono-si module price dropped to US$0.300-0.425/W. 270-275W general multi-si module price lowered to US$0.241-0.260/W. 280-285W high-efficiency multi-si module price slightly fell to US$0.265-0.283/W.

Although the price of mono-si wafer fell again last week, the multi-si supply chain showed a strong price resilience this week due to steady demand, making the market’s atmosphere similar to last week. Meanwhile, India’s new trade barrier policy has brought new issues to the market. In the early stage, the policies will only affect India’s domestic PV industry. Most of the large-scale integrated manufacturers will be unaffected.
Polysilicon
This week, the overhaul of China’s domestic polysilicon manufacturers continued according to plan, and the polysilicon market hasn’t changed too much. Although last week mono-si wafer price dropped, multi-si wafer had sufficient demand support, making the price become flat. However, the current market conditions also prevent it from rising. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has reached RMB 80-90/KG, and mono-si material price has maintained the level of RMB 95-105/KG. Overseas multi-si material price hasn’t changed much.
Si-wafer
This week, mono-si wafer price decreased to RMB 3.10-3.26/Pc, as expected. Due to downstream demand support, so far, multi-si wafer price has stabilized at RMB 2.45/Pc and black silicon product price has been RMB 2.50/Pc. Overseas prices have started to reflect price reduction, with US$0.395-0.410/Pc for mono-si wafer price and US$0.311-0.375/Pc for multi-si price. Owing to the demand as well, black silicon multi-si wafer price has slightly increased to US$0.375/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the capacity utilization of PV cell plants has grown, and the supply and demand have started to show a reversed trend. There were unfavorable news for the overseas market, affecting manufacturer layout and market trend.
The general multi-si PV cell in China had the demand support of photovoltaic poverty alleviation, but there was no obvious market for high-efficiency multi-si. The price of mono-si PV cell was reduced due to upstream si-wafer price, as well as the psychological expectation of low price for the procurement projects of the Top Runner Program. So far, China’s general mono-si PV cell price has maintained at RMB 1.05-1.15/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has fallen to RMB 1.15-1.21/W. General multi-si PV cell price was RMB 0.93-1.10/W.
For overseas markets, general mono-si price declined to US$0.142-0.145/W. High-efficiency mono-si PV cell price dropped to US$0.174-0.179/W because of upstream price reduction. Yet, multi-si price remained at US$0.133-0.158/W, with the support on the market.
Module
This week, China’s module market was stable, and the price didn’t change much. The 270W module inventory of China’s first-tier manufacturers wasn’t large. The main demand came from photovoltaic poverty alleviation, and the price slightly fell to RMB 1.80-2.05/W. High-efficiency multi-si module price dropped to RMB 1.85-2.20/W owing to the lack of demand. For the same reason, general mono-si module price decreased to RMB 2.10-2.20/W. High-efficiency mono-si price remained at RMB 2.30-2.40/W.
The overall price on the overseas market has kept falling, with US$0.257-0.407/W for mono-si (290-295W) and US$0.287-0.425/W for high-efficiency mono-si (above 300W). Prices of general multi-si (270-275W) and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) decreased to US$0.231-0.265/W and US$0.247-0.283/W, respectively.

Last week’s mono-si wafer price reduction effect continued to ferment this week, making the price difference between mono-si and multi-si wafers smaller. Multi-si wafer was still supported by market demand. The upstream supply was quite tight, so multi-si wafer hasn’t enlarged the price gap. India’s launch of defensive tariffs and the impending expiry of European MIP have spread across the market, triggering irrational purchasing and hoarding behavior that can cause prices to fluctuate. Due to the disruptive market conditions, trading requires a rational view of the supply and demand relationship.
Polysilicon
Supply of polysilicon manufacturers in China was tight this week, making the price of multi-si materialstop falling. Output in August may be lower than in July due to the manufacturers’ routine maintenances. So far, the price of multi-si material in China has reached RMB83-90/KG, and the price of mono-si material has remained at RMB95-105/KG. Overseas multi-si material price started to reflect market status, with bottom price below US$10.0/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, si-wafer demand was roughly balanced, and price changes weren’t significant. Although upstream supply of multi-si wafer was tight, due to the uncertain factors of downstream orders, the price was unable to increase. The reasonable price was established at RMB2.45-2.55/Pc. Black silicon product price remained at RMB2.80/Pc. Mono-si wafer price has decreased, with a reasonable price of RMB3.15-3.26/Pc. Overseas price outside China hasn’t changed too much. The price difference of mono-si wafer converged to US$0.400-0.425/Pc. Prices of general multi-si wafer and black wafer maintained at US$0.311-0.375/Pc and US$0.375/Pc, respectively.
PV cell
The multiple factors in the international market which have led to the disruptive situation in the multi-si market include: India’s defensive tariffs which have affected the multi-si PV cell orders in China; Turkey’s summer holidays which resulted in unstable demand; and Europe’s MIP, which will either be canceled or extended. The general reaction towards these disruptive events was slightly extreme and irrational. There were dealers stocking up orders to meet customer demand, while some dealers took a wait-and-see attitude. This situation has led to a decline in Taiwan’s PV cell prices, and the main price fell within US$0.13-0.134/w. Multi-si PV cell price of Chinese manufacturers remained at RMB1.02-1.05/w.
On the other hand, China’s photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects have started to stock up orders,mainly conventional multi-si or even low-efficiencyproducts. 18.4-18.5% efficiency PV cell price of small- and medium-sized enterprises in China basically reached RMB 0.9-0.95/W and general multi-si achieved RMB 0.93-1.06/W. Because multi-si order overall looked empty, more than 18.7% efficiency multi-si PV cellprice of small- and medium-sized enterprises also fell to RMB 1.02-1.03/W.
Due to the price reduction of mono-si wafer, the price–performance ratio of mono-si products was high, but the intensity of stocking up orders was weak. So far, China’s general mono-si PV cell price has been RMB 1.05-1.15/W, but the average price has declined to RMB 1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has stabilized at RMB 1.15-1.21/W.
For overseas markets, general mono-si price remained unchanged at US$0.142-0.145/W, while high-efficiency mono-si price was revised downwards to US$0.170-0.175/W. Multi-si PV cell price has also been revised downwards to US$0.129-0.158/W due to market uncertainty.
Module
The Chinese market had a redistribution of distributed PV orders, up from about 20% before the 531 new policy was announced. With the demand of poverty alleviation system, 270W module continued to destock, with a slight decline in price of RMB 1.8-2.0/W. High-efficiency multi-si price has been RMB 1.85-2.2/W. General mono-si module price decreased to RMB2.05-2.15/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been reduced to RMB2.20-2.35/W, mainly because the demand for mono-si has not officially started.
It is worth noting that although the 275W module still has a quote of about RMB1.95-2/W, the estimated cost for the end market in fact was around RMB 1.8/W. There are a number of orders in September and October, so the expected price drop pressure will increase after August.
For overseas markets, only the average price of multi-si module fell slightly. General multi-si (270-275W) price was US$0.231-0.265/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price decreased to US$0.247-0.275/W.

Polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers continued to respond to slowing demand this week with capacity control. The overall price is now balanced by limited supply and the demand side’s inventory preparations. Changes in the downstream overseas markets are still influenced by the safeguard duty in India and the impending expiry of the European MIP, and Taiwan’s capacity has been replaced by the flexibility of capacity in Southeast Asia, which has led to an unexpected rise in prices in the region. As these developments have all been influenced by the spread of market information, the outlook of the market’s supply and demand will still depend on the flexible distribution of each manufacturer.
Polysilicon
This week, there have been polysilicon orders signed to the end of August in China, but the overall situation was still limited by capacity allocation. So far, the overhaul plan has affected 14,000-15,000 tons of capacity, including two overseas manufacturers, so the polysilicon supply in August is expected to remain tight. Yet, due to the unreleased demand, the price roughly remained stable. So far, the price of multi-si material in China has reached RMB 83-90/KG, and the price of mono-si material has slightly reduced to RMB 90-98/KG, making the price difference between mono-si and multi-si become small. Overseas multi-si material price has stabilized at above US$10.3/KG.
Si-wafer
Owing to the balanced supply and demand and the lack of excessive issue on the market, si-wafer price this week was flat. So far, the reasonable prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer remained at RMB 3.15-3.26/Pcand RMB 2.40-2.45/Pc, respectively. Black silicon product price also maintained at RMB 2.80/Pc. Prices on the overseas market became unchanged. Prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer were US$0.400-0.425/Pcand US$0.311-0.375/Pc. Black wafer price was US$0.375/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the PV cell trading market began to be affected by the anticipations of fluctuations in overseas markets such as India and Europe, with significant price movements and mixed movements in individual areas.
China’s domestic market demand slowed down. Small- and medium-sized manufacturers suspended the offer of general mono-si PV cell, squeezing the price of first-tier manufacturers. So far, China’s general mono-si PV cell price has decreased to RMB 1.04-1.10/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has reached RMB 1.13-1.20/W. Affected by the sluggish market condition, general multi-si PV cell price has declined to RMB 0.93-1.03/W.
The decline in supply chain has spread to overseas markets. This week, international general mono-si PVcell price lowered to US$0.127-0.140/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price was revised to US$0.167-0.170/W. Due to market support, multi-si PV cell price can maintain at US$0.128-0.158/W.
Module
Domestic demand in China has not picked up, and many module manufacturers have moved overseas to balance supply and demand through global demand, making price fluctuation become steady. Yet, because of the cacophony on the international market, the balance isn’t expected to last long.
So far, general multi-si module (270-275W) price in China has maintained at RMB 1.80-2.00/W, and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has stabilized at RMB 1.85-2.15/W. Prices of general mono-si (290-295W) and high-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) reduced to RMB 1.90-2.20/W and RMB 2.10-2.25/W. It is worth noting that the transaction prices of general mono-si and high-efficiency multi-si module overlapped obviously, which shows that these products have a great deal of bargaining space in the market.
There were mixed movements in each region on the overseas market. Yet, the capacity in Southeast Asia has replaced the capacity in Taiwan because there were no trade barriers to India and Europe. Thus, the price increased. General multi-si module price was US$0.231-0.285/W, but Southeast Asia-based general multi-si module price slightly grew to US$0.280/W. International high-efficiency multi-si module price was US$0.247-0.288/W, but Southeast Asia-based price slightly increased to US$0.285/W. Prices of general mono-si and high-efficiency mono-si module were unchanged, but their price ranges narrowed to US$0.251-0.402/W and US$0.279-0.42/W.

","polysilicon orders signed to the end of August in China, but the overall situation was still limited by capacity allocation. So far, the overhaul plan has affected 14,000-15,000 tons of capacity, including two overseas manufacturers, so the polysilicon supply in August is expected to remain tight. Yet, due to the unreleased demand, the price roughly remained stable. So far, the price of multi-si material in China has reached RMB 83-90/KG, and the price of mono-si material has slightly reduced to RMB 90-98/KG, making the price difference between mono-si and multi-si become small. Overseas multi-si material price has stabilized at above US$10.3/KG"

The overall market status this week has been a relatively smooth one since China’s “531” new policies were implemented. The drop in production of upstream polysilicon is gradually coming to an end. In terms of si-wafer, the limited supply and stable demand caused prices to remain deadlocked. In the PV cell market, manufacturers are either stocking up or clearing out their inventories, which may be related to the scale of their businesses. Module price and volume have remained steady, and the dealers are obviously looking forward to subsequent new orders. As the market is getting out of rock bottom, there may be a lively change in each sector next month.
Polysilicon
China’s domestic polysilicon market was stable this week. Orders next month are still being negotiated, so the price didn’t change too much. Due to the lowered impact of routine maintenance, Xinte and SINOSICO will gradually return to full production in September, and Xinjiang GCL and Tongwei’s newly added capacity is expected to start production in September. In October, their contribution will be seen on the market. Thus, polysilicon output in August and in September are expected to be the same, and the market will become relatively stable. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has remained at RMB83-90/KG, and mono-si material price has reached RMB90-98/KG. Overseas multi-si material price has maintained at US$10.3-13.5/KG.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer’s supply and demand remain balanced this week. There was no excessive noise on the market, and the price was more stable. So far, the reasonable transaction prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer have been RMB3.15-3.26/Pcand RMB2.40-2.45/Pc, respectively. Black silicon product price also maintained at RMB2.80/Pc. However, sales of low-priced mono-si wafers began to appear on the market, driving down the price of mono-si wafers in the Chinese market, which is estimated to be related to de-stocking. There was also little change in overseas prices, with mono-si wafer, multi-si wafer and black silicon product maintaining prices of US$0.400-0.425/Pc, US$0.311-0.375/Pc and US$0.375/Pc, respectively.
PV cell
Demand for multi-si products has fallen sharply this week, leading to a sluggish condition. The impact of uncertainty over India’s safeguard duty grew, with some PV cell plants in China taking in as much as 25% of their own tariffs, resulting in heavy losses. To deal with the situation, some PV cell plants have adjusted their utilization rate, while first tier manufacturers are piling up their inventory.
China’s domestic demand for mono-si products slowed down. Small- and medium-sized manufacturers have suspended the offer of general mono-si PV cell; but there has been early inquiries from module plants for PERC high-efficiency PV cell. So far, China’s domestic general mono-si PV cell price has decreased to RMB1.02-1.10/W, and high-efficiency mono-si PV cell price has achieved RMB1.13-1.21/W. In terms of multi-si, general multi-si PV cell price has declined to RMB0.93-0.97RMB/W. High-efficiency black silicon product price has been RMB4.5-4.7/Pc (RMB0.95~1.00/W). Some plants controlled the cost of black silicon product price to RMB4.3/Pc (RMB0.90/W).
Overseas market’s PV cell price continued to be revised. General mono-si and high-efficiency mono-si prices were US$0.124-0.140/W and US$0.163-0.170/W. Yet, the average price of high-efficiency mono-si PV cell reduced to US$0.165/W. As demand of multi-si weakened, the price slipped slightly to US$0.123-0.155/W, and the average price dropped to US$0.129/W.
Module
China’s domestic module market this week mainly looked forward to the future, and experienced little changes. Yet, many plants have begun to negotiate orders for September. So far, general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.80-2.00/W, and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been RMB1.85-2.15/W. Prices of general mono-si (290-295W) and high-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) were RMB1.90-2.20/W and RMB2.10-2.25/W.
The overseas market remained roughly unchanged, except that the price of general mono-si (290-295W) fell to US$0.251-0.402/W. The prices of general multi-si, high-efficiency multi-si and high-efficiency mono-si were flat, at US$0.228-0.285D/W, US$0.245-0.288/W and US$0.279-0.420/W, respectively.

There have been a number of policy announcements in the market this week, all of which could affect trading conditions. These include the postponement of the safeguard duty hearing in India, the end of EU’s MIP on September 3, the inclusion of solar products in the second wave of Section 301 and the beginning of discussions by China’s National Energy Administration on policies for unsubsidized power stations. Overall, upstream polysilicon price has remained flat, with some increases. For si-wafer, production reduction was conducted to cope with the weak demand. PV cell and module prices were reduced to different levels due to product type. This week’s price and volume remained broadly stable. The key is whether the supply and demand sides can agree on the price.
Polysilicon
Although China’s domestic polysilicon market basically became stable this week, there was an unstable atmosphere because some manufacturers didn’t sign the orders of September. In September, there will still be enterprises conducting routine maintenance, intending to sign orders after the market becomes stable. On the other hand, some individual manufacturers in August conducted maintenance due to emergencies. Late orders for August will have to be issued in September.
In September, four new enterprises will undergo maintenance, while four of the enterprises currently undergoing maintenance are recovering production, so it is expected that the domestic production in September will be about the same as in August, and that the market operation would maintain a relatively stable trend. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has remained at RMB83-92/KG, with a slight increase for the highest price. Mono-si material price has remained at RMB90-98/KG. Overseas multi-si material price has been maintained at US$10.3-13.5/KG.
Si-wafer
Due to weaker end demand for multi-si, major multi-si wafer manufacturers have begun to feel the pressure of inventory this week, and prices have significantly become unstable. The supply side began to consider reducing production to deal with the situation. The supply of mono-si waferwas still under control, but lowering capacity utilization next month was also considered. So far, mono-si wafer price has remained at RMB3.05-3.26/Pc. The reasonable transaction price of multi-si has been RMB2.28-2.35/Pc. Black silicon product price has decreased to RMB2.60/Pc. The price of mono-si wafer in overseas market has remained at US$0.400-0.425/Pc, while multi-si price has declined to US$0.304-0.320/Pc. Black silicon product price has been lowered to US$0.360/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the price of PV cell continued to decline, especially high-efficiency mono-si, both for the domestic and overseas markets. A new round of price competition is expected after the end of the MIP in September. Because the PV cells made in China can also be supplied to the European market, it will cause more pressure on Taiwanese manufacturers. In addition, uncertainty factors continued to increase during the safeguard duty hearing in India, which was postponed to September 19.
Mono-si PERC PV cell price has been reduced. So far, China’s domestic general mono-si price has reached RMB1.02-1.10/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.08-1.21/W. General multi-si PV cell price has reached RMB0.93-0.97/W. Overseas general mono-si price has been US$0.124-0.140/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has decreased to US$0.161-0.165/W, with the average price of US$0.163/W. Multi-si PV cell price has remained at US$0.118-0.155/W, with the average price of US$0.121/W.
Module
This week, the module market in China was steady. The capacity utilization of many manufacturers was high, but the demand hasn’t reached the highest point. So far, general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.85-1.93/W, and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been RMB1.80-2.00/W. Prices of general mono-si (290-295W) and high-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) were RMB1.90-2.20/W and RMB2.10-2.25/W.

Market demand remained weak and prices continued to drop this week. The end of EU’s MIP will indeed lead to a downward trend in local transaction prices, but buyers and sellers are about to negotiate and it will be some time before it affects actual transaction prices. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers continued to control production to cope with weak demand, and si-wafer manufacturers may cut capacity utilization again. Demand of PV cell and module was weak. Some module manufacturers considered stockpiling in advance to avoid low-priced sales, waiting for the arrival of the peak season at the end of the month.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon supply and demand mostly remained flat. In September, there will be nearly 2000 tons of supply reduced due to routine maintenance in China. Yet, there will be manufacturers restoring production. The supply volume of the entire month is expected to be a little different compared to August. Thus, price stability can be maintained, and there may even be an upward adjustment. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has remained at RMB83-92/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at RMB90-98/KG. For overseas multi-si material, due to the weak demand in China, the bargaining space of long term orders became big. The price has been affected, with current price at US$10.3-12.3/KG and average price at US$11.5/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the price of si-wafer declined with weak demand. Major multi-si wafer manufacturers began to reduce capacity utilization, hoping to control the supply to stabilize prices. Mono-si wafer price held steady, but lowering capacity utilization has been considered. However, small- and medium-sized factories have been unable to support the price. They started selling at low prices, making the prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer drop to RMB2.90-3.25/PcandRMB 2.25-2.30/Pc. Black silicon product price has decreased to RMB 2.50/Pc. The price of mono-si wafer in overseas market has remained at US$0.400-0.425/Pc, while multi-si price has slightly declined to US$0.300-0.310/Pc. Black silicon product price has been lowered to US$0.350/Pc.
PV cell
Taiwanese and Southeast Asian PV cell manufacturers were forced to decrease price to the same level as Chinese PV cell this week, influenced by the end of EU’s MIP. So far, China’s domestic general mono-si price has reached RMB1.00-1.06/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.07-1.15/W. General multi-si price has been RMB0.93-0.97/W.
For overseas market, general mono-si price has reached US$0.117-0.138/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been reduced to US$0.155-0.163/W, with average price of US$0.162/W. For multi-si, the price has been maintained at US$0.111-0.142/W, with the drop of average price to US$0.112/W.
Module
In the same way as PV cell segment, for the modules made in southeast Asia, their prices have been pushed down to the same level as Chinese products. The quotes of China’s domestic module manufacturers are similar to last week’s. Although the demand was weak, owing to limited price reduction space, price has decreased slowly. So far, general multi-si (270-275W) price has been lowered to RMB 1.80-1.90/W, and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has also been RMB1.80-1.90/W.

Prices in the international market this week have fallen as a result of policy changes. Although the prices of China’s domestic market have stopped falling, the overall demand has remained sluggish. Polysilicon price decreased slightly due to weak demand. Si-wafer manufacturers continued to reduce capacity utilization to stabilize prices. For the PV cells and modules, the prices have changed differently, due to inconsistent demands. It is estimated that this mixed hot and cold situation will continue for a short period of time.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon price fell this week on a temporary basis due to poor supply and demandlinks, and price changes are expected to occur after the increase of demand. China’s domestic overhaul companies have decreased from 12 in August to 9 at present, and the production will gradually return to full capacity. There is limited scope for price increases for polysilicon, which have not yet seen significant support from demand. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has reached RMB83-88/KG, and mono-si material price has dropped slightly to RMB90-95/KG. Overseas multi-si material price hasn’t changed much, with the current price of US$10.3-12.3/KG and average price at US$11.5/KG.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer prices at home and abroad have held steady this week. Major multi-si wafer manufacturers began to reduce capacity utilization to less than 60%, hoping to adjust the output to control price; for mono-si wafer, there was no adjustments. So far, prices of mono-si and multi-si wafer have stayed at RMB2.90-3.25/Pc and RMB 2.25-2.30/Pc, respectively. Black silicon product price has also remained at RMB2.50/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at US$0.400-0.425/Pc, and multi-si wafer price has declined slightly to US$0.285-0.310/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at US$0.350/Pc.
PV cell
Owing to the end of EU’s MIP, China’s PV cell demand has grown. The overall operating rate and stock levels have improved, but there was still bidding phenomenon. So far, China’s domestic general mono-si PV cell price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has reached RMB1.07-1.18/W. General multi-si PV cell price has been reduced slightly to RMB0.91-0.95/W.

Module
Domestic demand for module in China was subdued this week, but prices were broadly stable due to cost constraints. High-efficiency mono-si module has begun to receive enquiries, which is expected to be linked to the construction of the Top Runner Program in Q4. So far, China’s domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.90/W, and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been RMB1.80-1.90/W.

The market trend this week was similar to last week: prices in overseas markets have continued to decline, while prices in the domestic market have decreased according to the capacity utilizationof large and small manufacturers. Multi-si wafer manufacturers have cut production in response to reduced demand, causing prices of upstream multi-si materials to drop slightly, and si-wafer manufacturers have been unable to maintain their prices. For PV cell and module, major manufacturers continued to squeeze small- and medium-sized manufacturers and overseas manufacturers, so the overall price decreased.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon orders for October have not yet been finalized, mainly because of inconsistent expectations of subsequent price changes. Price basically remained stable this week. China’s domestic overhaul companies have gradually returned to normal capacity, with supply slightly higher in September than in August. Yet, due to the lack of specific demand support and the decrease of downstream si-wafer production, the price is bound to continue to fall. So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has slightly declined to RMB81~88/KG, and mono-si material price has remained at RMB90~95/KG. Overseas multi-si material price hasn’t changed much, with the current price of US$10.3-12.3/KGand average price at US$11.5/KG.

Black silicon product price has dropped to US$0.337/Pc.
PV cell
As inventory levels increased owing to the full capacity of China’s first-tier PV cell manufacturers, putting pressure on second- and third-tier manufacturersand Taiwanese manufacturers, and as China’s first-tier manufacturersbegin to compete in Europe and India, their full-load strategy will hit rivals hard.
High-efficiency mono-siPV cell price started to grow slightly because of the demand of the Top Runner Program. So far, China’s domestic general mono-si price has reached RMB0.98-1.06/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.18/W. Due to weak demand, general multi-si PV cell price has decreased to RMB0.87-0.94/W. For overseas market, only general mono-si PV cell price has remained at US$0.117-0.138/W.

This week, the overall market was affected by China’s upcoming National Day holiday, and the market was looking forward to the fermentation of high season after the long holiday. Although there was demand for some products, the prices didn’t increase. Besides, the stability of downstream module price in overseas markets is expected to be related to the arrival of China’s National Day holiday. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers have further lowered their productiondue to the arrival of the long holiday. Si-wafer manufacturers reduced capacity utilization to look forward to the stop of price fall. In terms of PV cell and module, the developments varied according to different product categories. The gearing up for mono-si products and the silence for multi-si products reflect the demand of the market for individual products. Perhaps after the long holiday, the situation will be different.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon price has slightly dropped. The expected price of orders in October was revised downward. In the next two weeks, the price fall is expected to end as inventories of downstreammono-si wafer gradually bottoms out. The domestic companies in China that conducted routine maintenances have gradually returned to normal capacity. The new expansion of capacity in September will gradually reflect the production of October. The expected future price trend will be based on the actual capacity utilization of each plant.
So far, China’s domestic multi-si material price has slightly changed to RMB80-86/KG, and mono-si material price has remained at RMB87-90/KG. Overseas multi-si material price hasn’t changed, with the current price of USD10.3-12.3/KG and average price at USD11.5/KG.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer price this week varied according to the extent of demand. Multi-si wafer manufacturers lowered the capacity utilization because of the upcoming long holiday and weak demand. Prices slowly declined. Mono-si wafer manufacturers have not made any changes to their monthly quotations. They have not followed the downward adjustment of multi-si wafer, mainly because the rising demand became more obvious.
So far, mono-si wafer price has remained at RMB2.90-3.25/Pc, and multi-si wafer price has dropped to RMB2.20-2.25/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.30/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at USD0.400-0.415/Pc, and multi-si wafer price has fallen to USD0.284-0.285/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.337/Pc.
PV cell
This week, there were two extreme conditions for PV cell price. Multi-si price and demand were still weak. For mono-si, under the influence of China’s domestic demands and Europe’s rising orders, high-priced products have stabilized prices in order to increase.
So far, China’s domestic general mono-si price has reached RMB0.98-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.18/W, with conversion efficiency above 21.5%. The PV cell price in accordance with 310W components has been RMB1.11-1.23/W. For multi-si, the general PV cell price has dropped to RMB0.86-0.90/W. Overseas general mono-si price has reached USD0.117-0.138/W, and high-efficiency mono-si price has been lowered to USD0.150-0.160/W, with the average price increasing to USD0.158/W. Multi-si price has also been reduced to USD0.103-0.140/W, with the average price dropping to USD0.104/W.
Module
This week, China’s domestic module price varied according to the performance of different product categories. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) and general multi-si (270-275W) were clearly separated. General mono-si (290-295W) price and high-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price have been close since July and August, yet, this week the gap between them was widened. The rise of general mono-si price resulted in a larger gap, reflecting the variation in demands for different products.
So far, domestic general multi-si price has been RMB1.80~1.92/W, with an unchanged average price. High-efficiency multi-si price has been RMB1.87-2.10/W, with the average price increasing to RMB1.95/W. General mono-si price has reached RMB1.90-2.30/W, with the average price increasing to RMB2.00/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB2.10-2.20/W, with an unchanged average price. Overseas prices have remained the same: USD0.218-0.260/W for general multi-si price, USD0.223-0.244/W for high-efficiency multi-si price, USD0.247-0.400/W for general mono-si price and USD0.265-0.415/W for high-efficiency mono-si price.

This week, due to China’s National Day holiday, there were only overseas prices on the market, and the overall supply chain is not expected to change until next week. Besides, the capacity utilization of China’s upstream multi-si material will determine the adequacy of the overall supply side, while downstream module can only look forward to the expected delivery of orders in Q4.
Polysilicon
This week, overseas polysilicon price fell as expected, following last week’s Chinese domestic price decline, with the average price showing a slight decrease. So far, the price has been maintained at USD10.0-12.3/KG, with the average price dropping to USD10.9/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, si-wafer prices in Chinese and overseas markets have not changed much, mainly because of China’s National Day holiday and weak demand. Although there were deals, prices have not been affected. Overseas mono-si price has remained at USD0.400-0.405/Pc. Multi-si price has dropped to USD0.284-0.285/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.337/Pc.
PV cell
This week, overseas mono-si PV cell price has been slightly revised downwards, and the average price of multi-si PV cell has remained the same, with a smaller interval. So far, overseas general mono-si price has been USD0.117-0.132/W, with the average price decreasing to USD0.130/W.

The prices of each segment in the supply chain have mostly fallen this week. Upstream polysilicon price significantly declined. Mono-si and multi-si wafer prices showed two different trends. There were both increases and decreases for PV cell price, and module price slowly dropped. Overall, high-efficiency mono-si products are still favored by the market, and demand from other types of products may change into high-efficiency mono-si. Despite entering the peak season, the market’s price trend will still be unpredictable due to the changes in demand for products.
Polysilicon
This week, the entire polysilicon market’s prices showed a small decline. Though orders of multi-si material in China were small and prices slightly decreased, the prices of the first-tier manufacturers still remained at RMB80/kg. There was some demand for mono-si material, but due to the rising supply, its prices are expected to fluctuate for some time. For overseas polysilicon price, it was close to Chinesedomestic price, and price of the major manufacturers fell.
So far, Chinesedomestic multi-si material price has reached RMB75-85/KG, with the average price dropping to RMB80/KG. Mono-si material price has been RMB85-90/KG, with the average price dropping to RMB88/KG. Overseas price has decreased to USD9.5-10.5/KG, with the average price dropping to USD10.09/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, mono-si and multi-si wafer prices developed two different trends. Owing to the stable demand, mono-si wafer price remained steady; because of the weak demand, multi-si wafer price still dropped, and the inventory level of first-tier manufacturers increased. It is estimated that it will take some time to destock the inventory. So far, Chinesedomestic mono-si wafer price has remained at RMB3.00-3.26/Pc, with an unchanged average price of RMB3.15/Pc. Multi-si wafer price has declined to RMB2.15-2.23/Pc. Black silicon product price has also decreased to RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has been maintained at USD0.400-0.405/Pc. Multi-si price has dropped to USD0.278-0.282/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.337/Pc.
PV cell
This week, PV cell price varied depending on product category and region. Chinese, European and the US markets started to move toward high-efficiency mono-si module, forcing demand for multi-si products to be reduced. In particular, China’s domestic system manufacturers began to change the system design from multi-si to mono-si, which may worsen the multi-si supply chain.
So far, Chinesedomestic general mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W, with the average price slightly rising to RMB1.02/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.11-1.19/W, with an unchanged average price of RMB1.15/W. 310Wultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has reached RMB1.20/W. Because there was still demand on the market, general multi-si PV cell price has slightly grown to RMB0.88-0.91/W, with the average price slightly rising to RMB0.89/W.
Overseas general mono-si price has been USD0.117-0.132/W, with an unchanged average price of USD0.130/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at USD0.150-0.159/W, with an unchanged average price of USD0.155/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has surpassed USD0.160/W. Multi-si price has slightly declined to USD0.102-0.133/W, with the average price slightly dropping to USD0.103/W.
Module
Domestic demand has not warmed up after China’s National Day holiday, while prices in the overseas markets have generally followed the movements in the Chinese market, where manufacturers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Domestic module price has fallen slightly this week, but stronger demand is expected over the next week or two, which will lead to further price change.
So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has been lowered to RMB1.78-1.83/W, with the average price dropping to RMB1.80/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been RMB1.85-1.90/W, with the average price dropping to RMB1.87/W.

This week, there were both increases and decreases on the overall market. Both overseas and domestic polysilicon prices declined. For si-wafer, mono-si and multi-si wafer prices still showed two different trends. PV cell price and module price varied according to the change of supply and demand in each regional market. Overall, high-efficiency mono-si products were popular among the overseas and domestic markets. Inquiries about general or secondary multi-si products were boosted by local demand for distributed PV power in China. It remains to be seen whether they can become the new growth drivers in the multi-si market.
Polysilicon
Supply and demand pressure caused by weak demand has begun to affect polysilicon manufacturers. Overseas polysilicon price followed the domestic price, and continued to drop. The overall price moved closer to the domestic price. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been RMB75-82/KG, and mono-si material price has been RMB81-90/KG, with the average price falling to RMB85/KG. Overseas price has decreased to USD9.3-10.3/KG, with the average price falling to USD9.87/KG. As demand has not picked up, some polysilicon manufacturers have pushed back the timetable for new capacity to slow the decline in prices by controlling supply.
Si-wafer
This week, mono-si and multi-si wafer prices still developed two different trends. Mono-si wafer price remained steady. As its market demand has increased, its price may have a chance to rise next week. For multi-si, because of the weak demand, multi-si wafer price declined, and the inventory level of first-tier manufacturers increased. It is estimated that it will take some time to destock the inventory. So far, Chinesedomestic mono-si wafer price has remained at RMB3.00-3.26/Pc. Multi-si wafer price has declined to RMB2.10-2.23/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has been maintained at USD0.400-0.405/Pc. Multi-si price has dropped to USD0.270-0.282/Pc, with an unchanged average price of USD0.280/Pc. Black silicon product price has been reduced to USD0.320/Pc.
PV cell
Demand for different PV cell products remained mixed in different markets this week, as prices fluctuated. Due to China’s Top Runner Program and Turkey’s orders, the stock up demands for high-efficiency mono-si products have started to increase. India’s stocking up momentum for 325W multi-si PV cell strengthened, which helped to stabilize multi-si PV cell price under low supply. So far, Chinesedomestic general mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has slightly increased to RMB1.12-1.18/W, with an unchanged average price of RMB1.18/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at RMB1.20/W. General multi-si PV cell price has slightly decreased to RMB0.84-0.89/W, with the average price falling to RMB0.87/W. Overseas general mono-si price has narrowed the spread range to USD0.119-0.132/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has extended the spread range to USD0.137-0.165/W, with the average price rising to USD0.157/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has reached USD0.168/W, and multi-si price has remained at USD0.102-0.133/W.
In addition, market inquiries of double-sided PV cell increased owing to the Top Runner Program. So far, the price has been RMB1.20-1.30/W. Due to different pricing modes, it is difficult to reach a consensus price, and market acceptance needs to be improved.
Module
This week, the market status and price trend of module were similar to PV cell. Conditions of overseas and domestic markets and suppliers were different. The capacity utilization of first-tier manufacturers was boosted because of the stable demand. Second-tier and third-tier manufacturers, which rely solely on Chinese domestic demand and are exposed to more risks than first-tier manufacturers, currently have demand inquiries of Top Runner Program and some locally distributed PV power, so prices of favored products were also polarized. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has grown to RMB1.78-1.85/W, with the average price rising to RMB1.82/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been lowered to RMB1.80-1.88/W, with an unchanged average price of RMB1.87/W.

Unlike the last three months, mono-si wafer price decreased unexpectedly this week, and the main reason for this is not yet known. The pressure of the supply side for polysilicon is still huge, and some manufacturers have been forced to either postpone the start of their new capacity or to suspend the recovery of existing capacity. For si-wafer, mono-si wafer price reduction boosted the decrease of multi-si price. The market status of PV cell and module is similar to the previous weeks, and only high-efficiency product demand increased. Overall, the market may need new momentum to maintain the balance between supply and demand.
Polysilicon
This week, the overall polysilicon price dropped, and the decrease of multi-si material price was larger, but the overall price appears to have room to fall. Orders of October for first-tier polysilicon manufacturers have been signed, with less impact; but previously closed small- and medium-sized plants or production lines with higher production costs are deciding whether to restart production lines or continue production stoppages.
Overseas polysilicon price moved closer to the domestic price. So far, domestic multi-si material price has reached RMB73-82/KG, with the average price falling to RMB77/KG. Mono-si material price has been RMB81-88/KG, with the average price falling to RMB84/KG. Overseas price has decreased to USD9.0-10.2/KG, with the average price falling to USD9.8/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, si-wafer price continued the trend of last week. Although the leading manufacturer of mono-si wafer reduced the price, the actual difference with the market price was not much, so the price still showed a steady decline pattern. Multi-si wafer price fell owing to weak demand and high inventory level. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.20/Pc, and multi-si price has dropped to RMB2.07-2.20/Pc. Black silicon product price has been maintained at RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has decreased to USD0.380-0.400/Pc, with the average price falling to USD0.390/Pc.

PV cell
This week, for PV cell, the market status of mono-si was good, while multi-si was poor. Besides, the overseas market was better than the domestic market. The capacity of first-tier manufacturers was full, and the capacity utilization of second- and third-tier manufacturers was below 40%. So far, domestic general mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has slightly increased to RMB1.12-1.17/W, with an unchanged average price of RMB1.15/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has grown to RMB1.16-1.22/W, with an unchanged average price of RMB1.18/W.

 This week the market didn’t pick up during the peak season. Small- and medium-sized manufacturers of polysilicon have begun to consider overhauling and reducing production to deal with prices which were lower than the cost. For si-wafer, production reduction measures have been adopted, and the general operating rate was less than half. For PV cell and module markets, the first-tier manufacturers reached full capacity, while the second- and third-tier manufacturers operated in a build-to-order environment. All enterprises were finding their own way of survival. Overall, this sluggish condition will continue into November. 
Polysilicon
Overall polysilicon price continued to be depressed this week, with the verdict for orders of November still being postponed in order to deal with the changes, reflecting the pessimistic attitude of the market towards end demand in the end of the year. In terms of price, supply and demand were roughly balanced and prices were supported by weekly turnover orders and inventory removal. Overseas polysilicon price continued to fall, making the gap between domestic and overseas prices become smaller. So far, the market price has been close to the cost of first-tier manufacturers. Second- and third-tier manufacturers can only barely maintain their businesses, and some are even starting to produce at a loss. Some of them may also have to restart maintenance and overhaul in order to avoid losses. So far, domestic multi-si material price has reached RMB74-82/KG, with the average price falling to RMB76/KG. Mono-si material price has been RMB80-86/KG, with an unchanged average price of RMB84/KG. Overseas price has remained at USD9.0-10.2/KG, with an unchanged average price of USD9.8/KG.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer price was still weak this week. The operating rate of multi-si wafer manufacturers was less than 50%, and second- and third-tier manufacturers were lower. Thus, although the demand was depressed, due to flat inventory level, there was no collapse in price. Most si-wafer manufacturers held the mentality of not working at a loss. In addition, last week, the price reduction of mono-si wafer has been completed.
So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.20/Pc, and multi-si price has dropped to RMB2.07-2.15/Pc. Black silicon product price has decreased to RMB2.20/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has declined to USD0.380-0.390/Pc, with the average price falling to USD0.381/Pc. Multi-si price has dropped to USD0.263-0.270/Pc, with the average price falling to USD0.269/Pc. Black silicon product price has been lowered to USD0.310/Pc.
PV cell
There was demand but weak transaction prices in some PV cell markets this week. The first-tier manufacturers still reached full capacity, while the second- and third-tier manufacturers operated in a build-to-order environment. Owing to the drop of solar power prices or possible changes in subsidy policies in some European countries, it could boost PV cell demand in November.
This week, overall PV cell price remained unchanged. Domestic general mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.17/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at RMB1.16-1.22/W. General multi-si PV cell price has been RMB0.80-0.85/W. Overseas general mono-si price has remained at USD0.123-0.129/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been USD0.142-0.165/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at USD0.148-0.168/W. Multi-si price has remained at USD0.102-0.133/W. Double-sided PV cell price has remained at RMB1.20-1.30/W.
Module
The module market this week was similar to the PV cell. Because there was no obvious demand and the trend was unpredictable, most dealers operated in a build-to-order environment. Therefore, the overall price this week didn’t change. Domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.75-1.85/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.93/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.96/W.

The overall market atmosphere this week was better than last week, but it was still not vibrant. The low-cost new capacity of polysilicon started to overshadow the high-cost old capacity, and si-wafer manufacturers are continuing to focus on costs; PV cell and module were stable under the dual benefits of low upstream cost and downstream demand support. On November 2, the NEA pointed out that its subsidy will continue, which made the current supply and demand trend become better. Compared to the downturn and uncertainty in the past few weeks, it can be considered as the calm after a storm.
Polysilicon
The delivery capacity of polysilicon orders for November has been released, and the overall price was generally stable. Although the average price of multi-si material was flat, the demand showed signs of improvement. Only one manufacturer of overseas polysilicon lowered the price, and the rest remained unchanged.
With the release of new capacity, low-cost capacity will gradually overshadow the high-cost old capacity. If the demand continues to be sluggish, some manufacturers will be forced to halt production before the end of the year and then withdraw from the market. So far, Chinese domestic multi-si material price has been RMB73-80/KG, with an unchanged average price of RMB76/KG; mono-si material price has been RMB80-85/KG, with the average price falling to RMB83/KG.

Because Chinese domestic multi-si wafer price was close to the cost, low-priced orders will be avoided in order to stabilize the price. There was no excessive change for mono-si wafer. So far, Chinese domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.20/Pc, and multi-si price has remained at RMB2.07-2.15/Pc. Black silicon product price has been maintained at RMB2.20/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc, and multi-si price has dropped to USD0.254-0.269/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.310/Pc.
PV cell
The PV cell market reacted differently at home and abroad this week, but overall, demand visibility in markets such as China, Europe and India was better than in October. Overseas PV cell price has decreased due to the reduction of upstream price, while Chinese domestic price has been stabilized owing to steady upstream price.
So far, Chinese domestic general multi-si price has been RMB0.80-0.85/W. General mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.17/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at RMB1.16-1.22/W. Overseas general multi-si price has declined to USD0.095-0.130/W, with the average price falling to USD0.100/W. General mono-si price has been lowered to USD0.121-0.129/W, with the average price falling to USD0.125/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at USD0.142-0.165/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has increased to USD0.155-0.172/W, with the average price growing to USD0.165/W. Double-sided PV cell price has remained at RMB1.20-1.28/W.
Module
Similar to the PV cell segment, this week, the demand visibility in the module market was clear. China’s Top Runner Program boosted the demand for high-efficiency products, and the poverty-alleviation PV projects can also help to digest some of the general multi-si product inventory levels. The overseas market mainly relied on Europe and India, and a few US developers have begun to make inquiries to the market.
This week, the overall price trend was similar to the PV cell. Chinese domestic trend was stable, while the overseas trend was volatile. Domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.75-1.85/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.93/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.96/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has remained at RMB2.12-2.20/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) price has remained at above RMB2.20/W. Overseas general multi-si price has been reduced to USD0.216-0.270/W, with the average price falling to USD0.218/W. High-efficiency multi-si price has remained at USD0.220-0.280/W, with the average price falling to USD0.239/W. General mono-si price range has been revised to USD0.242-0.360/W, with an unchanged average price of USD0.250/W. High-efficiency mono-si price range has been revised to USD0.265-0.390/W, with the average price falling to USD0.275/W.

This week’s market conditions have gradually become better compared with last week. As the supply and demand for polysilicon are still unstable, some manufacturers are bound to exit from the market. In the si-wafer segment, manufacturers are taking active steps to maintain their costs, so the situation is relatively more stable.
As the end market’s demand is still increasing, PV cell and module manufacturers will have a chance to improve their performance. With the Chinese government’s policy directives, which are expected to boost the market and stimulate demand, the condition will get better in the next few weeks.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon price was still moving at a low price. The first-tier manufacturers could slightly support the price compared with the second- and third-tier manufacturers. The newly opened low-cost production line has not yet fully reached mass production, causing some discrepancy between the supply and demand for cost calculation, which indirectly affected downstream purchase intention and price acceptance. After low-cost production line is opened and high-cost production line exits, it is estimated that the cost perception of buyers and sellers will be consistent, but the demand side still has the final price decision because if there is no strong demand, low price can be useless. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been RMB73-82/KG, with the average price falling to RMB75/KG. Mono-si material price has reached RMB80-84/KG, with the average price falling to RMB82/KG. Overseas price has remained at USD9.0-10.2/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, only overseas mono-si wafer price has been driven by demand. Multi-si wafer manufacturers have stabilized prices as the primary indicator and are no longer selling at a price lower than the cost. In terms of utilization rate, whether it is mono-si or multi-si, the first-tier manufacturers still had a large advantage, and the small- and medium-sized manufacturers were more difficult to survive under the double squeeze of price and capacity. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.10/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at RMB2.07-2.15/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.20/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at USD0.254-0.269/Pc. Black silicon product price has dropped slightly to USD0.305/Pc.
PV cell
This week, PV cell market still focused on high-efficiency products, and the mono-si PERC PV cells at home and abroad were sold out of stock. Multi-si products have been able to stabilize prices due to increasing demand. Visibility in global demand has increased, and it is estimated that December will be better than November.
So far, domestic general multi-si price has been RMB0.80-0.85/W. General mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.17/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has slightly grown to RMB1.20-1.25/W, with the average price increasing to RMB1.22/W. Double-sided PV cell price has enlarged to RMB1.25-1.30/W. Overseas general multi-si price has remained at USD0.095-0.130/W. General mono-si price has remained at USD0.121-0.129/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has increased to USD0.145-0.165/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has increased to USD0.160-0.172/W.
Module
The market price of the module market was roughly flat this week. Although the multi-si products had quotations, the actual transactions were not much, and the overall price was flat or even slightly decreased. The sales of mono-si modules were more active, but they could not drive up prices due to lack of urgent orders.
So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.78-1.85/W, with the average price falling to RMB1.80/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.93/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.96/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has remained at RMB2.12-2.20/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) price has remained at above RMB2.20/W. Overseas general multi-si price has been lowered to USD0.215-0.270/W, with the average price falling to USD0.216/W. The range of high-efficiency multi-si price has been revised to USD0.220-0.275/W.

This week, the overall market is still steadily moving forward. Polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers have mainly focused on the depth of the future supply chain development and are currently accepting orders on a non-loss basis. In terms of PV cell and module, the market visibility remains high, but the scale isn’t large enough. On the demand side, after the adjustment of China’s domestic demand policy, it is expected to gradually lead to reasonable market activity. The overseas orders are mainly taken by the first-tier manufacturers, and the big businesses on the supply side are expected to continue growing.
Polysilicon
This week, the price of polysilicon was stable. Multi-si material had fewer orders, and the price has been unable to fall. There were new orders for mono-si material, and the price has also stabilized. The orders of the first-tier manufacturers have been placed till December, and the inventory level has dropped to a reasonable range of about 3,000 tons. Manufacturers at home and abroad continued to carry out maintenance work to adjust and control the overall supply. The overall capacity of polysilicon this month is expected to reach 21,000 tons. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been RMB73-80/KG, and mono-si material price has been RMB80-84/KG. Overseas price has decreased to USD8.5-10.2/KG, with the average price falling to USD9.54/KG.
Si-wafer
The overall price of si-wafer was stable this week. Although the demand for mono-si continued to be strong, the price range remained unchanged; multi-si didn’t have much demand, but supply adjustment was appropriate, making the prices stable. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.10/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at RMB2.07-2.15/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.20/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at USD0.254-0.269/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.305/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the focus of PV cell market was still high-efficiency products. The demand for mono-si and multi-si PERC has increased, but prices between the large and small manufacturers have been swinging back and forth, making the final price of the market the same as last week. Afterwards, it is expected that big businesses will grow bigger.
So far, domestic general multi-si price has been RMB0.80-0.85/W. General mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.06/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.17/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has slightly grown to RMB1.20-1.25/W.

Double-sided PV cell price has remained at RMB1.25-1.30/W.
Module
Only a small number of regions had module deals this week. There was still no market for multi-si products, and the transaction price was slightly affected; mono-si module could maintain the price under the support of end demand. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.78-1.85/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.93/W.

Market demand has began to increase this week. Polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers have accepted orders on a non-loss basis; even if the demand starts to warm up, stabilizing the price is the primary goal. The PV cell and module sectors were based on different market demands and there were corresponding changes. The demand side of the overall market reflected different time periods of the regional markets at home and abroad. Once the demand signals are consistent, the market is expected to experience prosperity again.
Polysilicon
This week, the market demand for polysilicon was still low. Although the inventory level gradually increased, manufacturers couldn’t easily lower the previous price. The price didn’t have much room for correction, so it remained stable. As some small- and medium-sized manufacturers have begun to produce at below cash cost last week, some first-tier manufacturers are following in suit. Yet, the overall operation was in the form of selective order. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been RMB73-80/KG, and mono-si material price has been RMB80-82/KG. Overseas price has remained at USD8.5-10.2/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the price of si-wafer continued to maintain stability overseas, and there were some changes in China. Major manufacturers of mono-si wafer did not make price adjustments this month, which is estimated to be related to the increase in market demand; multi-si demand began to loosen. Although the price range was limited, the average price remained unchanged, mainly due to capacity adjustment and the temporary exit of some small- and medium-sized manufacturers. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.10/Pc, with the average price falling to RMB3.05/Pc. Multi-si price has increased to RMB2.08-2.20/Pc. Black silicon product price has increased to RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas prices have been unchanged. Mono-si price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at USD0.254-0.269/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.305/Pc.
PV cell
This week, small- and medium-sized PV cell manufacturers have reduced production, but the supply of large manufacturers was still prosperous, regardless of the demand for mono-si or multi-si PERC products, echoing the trend mentioned last week. So far, the prices of all domestic products in China have increased at the same time. Domestic general multi-si price has been RMB0.83-0.86/W, with the average price increasing to RMB0.85/W. General mono-si price has been RMB1.00-1.08/W, with the average price increasing to RMB1.04/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been RMB1.12-1.20/W, with the average price increasing to RMB1.16/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has slightly grown to RMB1.20-1.30/W, with the average price increasing to RMB1.25/W.
Overseas prices have been unchanged. General multi-si price has remained at USD0.093-0.130/W. General mono-si price has remained at USD0.121-0.129/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at USD0.145-0.165/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at USD0.160-0.172/W. Yet, double-sided PV cell price has slightly increased to RMB1.28-1.33/W.
Module
Although there were module demands in China this week, the price trend didn’t be affected; relatively speaking, overseas demand has slightly improved, and the transaction price has changed according to different regions. So far, the prices of all domestic products in China have been maintained at the same time. General multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.78-1.85/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.93/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.96/W.

The market demand this week has increased, and the supply chain has bounced back. Downstream momentum is expected to boost the upstream and overall supply chain. In terms of price, demand of polysilicon and si-wafer increased, but the prices weren’t affected significantly. For PV cell and module, there were different price changes brought by the demand for different product categories in different regions.
Polysilicon
The inventory level of polysilicon this week was still high, so even if the demand changes, the prices may not be increased easily, making them become stable. Orders of December have been largely determined. As end demand continues to heat up, de-stocking will be a key issue in the polysilicon sector. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been RMB72-78/KG, and mono-si material price has been RMB81-83/KG, with the average price falling to RMB81/KG. Overseas price has remained at USD8.5-10.2/KG.
Si-wafer
Si-wafer price has begun to loosen this week due to increasing market demand, and Chinese domestic mono-si and multi-si wafer prices were flat this week because of the rising pressure from downstream, but are expected to change next week. Overseas mono-si and multi-si wafer prices have echoed the actual demand and have increased.
So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.00-3.10/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at RMB2.08-2.20/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas mono-si price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc. Multi-si price has enlarged to USD0.255-0.275/Pc, with the average price increasing to USD0.265/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.305/Pc.
PV cell
There has been a marked change in the PV cell market this week. China’s multi-si PV cell price has risen, while mono-si price has remained unchanged, spurred by the need for grid-connected domestic demand before the end of the year and the stock-up momentum before Europe’s New Year. Overseas mono-si and multi-si PV cell prices, as well as high-efficiency mono-si PV cell price, have increased at the same time owing to the demand. So far, domestic general multi-si price has enlarged to RMB0.81-0.88/W, with the average price increasing to RMB0.86/W. General mono-si price has been maintained at RMB1.00-1.08/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at RMB1.12-1.20/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at RMB1.20-1.30/W.

Module
This week, overseas module market transaction price was temporarily stable. For the domestic market, only high-efficiency and low-priced product prices increased. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.78-1.85/W, with the average price increasing to RMB1.84/W.

The market as a whole has stabilized due to the robust demand, and prices are on a positive, upward trend. However, manufacturers across the supply chain have been very restrained in adjusting their quotes because they do not want significant fluctuations in price trends. Prices of polysilicon and wafers have held steady because there has been a significant turnaround in demand, and manufacturers in these markets have tightly controlled the supply of their products. Regarding the cell and module markets, prices have only increased marginally despite rising demand and even shortages for some products. The supply-demand relations across the supply chain are expected to gradually move toward a healthier state, and the positive mood of the market will likely persist for a prolonged period.
Polysilicon
Noticeable and positive changes have occurred in the polysilicon market this week. Suppliers’ inventories have fallen just as the downstream demand is starting to pick up. More medium- and small-size manufacturers in China and overseas markets have halted production. Currently in China, prices of polysilicon for multi-Si products are kept around RMB 72-78/kg, while prices of polysilicon for mono-Si products are kept around RMB 80-83/kg. Outside China, prices of polysilicon materials have held steady in the range of US$8.5-10.2/kg.
Wafers
Chinese suppliers have raised the capacity utilization rates of their multi-Si wafer production lines this week. As for their mono-Si wafer production, they now practically keep no stock at hand. Some Chinese suppliers are even prioritizing their shipments based on clients’ billing cycles. With these developments causing a positive shift in the supply-demand relations, prices of mono-Si wafers in China have risen to RMB 3.05-3.10/pc (the average has moved up to RMB 3.08/pc). Prices of multi-Si wafers in China have stayed constant in the range of RMB 2.08-2.20/pc. The average price of black silicon wafers (or the highest price for multi-Si wafers) in China has also remained stable at RMB 2.25/pc. Outside China, prices of mono-Si wafers are kept around US$0.380-0.390/pc, while prices of multi-Si wafers have moved up to around US$0.255-0.280/pc. The average of the multi-Si wafers outside China has risen to US$0.270/pc, while the price of black silicon wafers has remained at US$0.305/pc.
Cells
The cell market is still very hot this week, with demand practically exceeding supply for high-efficiency mono-Si cells from first-tier manufacturers. The supply of mono-Si products going to overseas markets is being squeezed by the rising demand in China. As a result, some clients outside China are willing to pay a higher price to secure their shipments. Currently in China, prices of conventional mono-Si cells, high-efficiency mono-Si cells, and superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) are in the ranges of RMB 1.00-1.08/W, RMB 1.12-1.20/W, and RMB 1.20-1.30/W, respectively.
Outside China, cell prices have generally gone up this week. Prices of conventional multi-Si cells have risen to US$0.102-0.130/W, with the average now sitting at US$0.109/W. Prices of conventional mono-Si cells have moved upward to US$0.135-0.155/W, with the average advancing to US$0.150/W. Prices of high-efficiency mono-Si cells have also risen to US$0.155-0.172/W, with the average climbing to US$0.168/W. On the other hand, prices of superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) have been maintained within the range of US$0.170-0.178/W. As for the market for bifacial cells, their prices are still selling at RMB 1.30/W or above.
Modules
Prices at which modules are sold have not changed significantly this week even as the market is seeing brisk orders. However, prices of high-efficiency modules have gone up in China due to demand outstripping supply.
Currently in China, prices of conventional multi-Si modules (270-275W) and high-efficiency multi-Si modules (280-285W) are kept within the ranges of RMB1.78-1.85/W and RMB 1.80-1.93/W, respectively. As for prices of mono-Si modules in China, the price ranges of conventional (290-295W), high-efficiency (300-305W), and superior high-efficiency (>310W) are RMB 1.83-1.96/W, RMB 2.10-2.20/W, and RMB 2.20/W or higher, respectively. Outside China, prices of conventional multi-Si modules and high-efficiency multi-Si modules have been holding steady in the ranges of US$0.205-0.265/W and US$0.210-0.275/W, respectively. Prices of mono-Si modules outside China have been stable as well, with prices of conventional and high-efficiency products maintaining within the ranges of US$0.242-0.360/W and US$0.265-0.380/W.

Market conditions came to a climax this week amid strong demand in various markets. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers effectively controlled the supply-side output, making the prices stable; although the market condition of PV cells and modules benefited from the continuous increase in demand, the price has not changed too much because the long term order prices of large manufacturers were stable and small quantity order prices were gradually moving towards large manufacturers. Overall, the market’s supply and demand is showing a positive trend. With the completion of grid connection in China, its future demand may show a slow decline; however, end-market demand will still be supported because the overseas market has started to stock up for the 2019 New Year.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon price continued last week’s stable situation. As the opening of new capacity and demand increased at the same time, mono-si material price remained flat; multi-si materials were also driven by demand, resulting in de-stocking. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been RMB71-79/KG, with the average price rising to RMB76/KG; mono-si material price has been RMB80-83/KG. Overseas price has remained at USD8.5-10.2/KG.
Si-wafer
Demand for si-wafer was still strong this week, but its price has not seen much gain. China’s domestic market demand for mono-si wafer began to slow down, and the overseas market stocked up before the 2019 New Year. For multi-si wafer, cash trading was the focus, causing a small price bargaining space. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.05-3.10/Pc. Multi-si price has been RMB2.05-2.20/Pc, with the average price dropping to RMB2.11/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas mono-si and multi-si wafer prices have not changed. Mono-si wafer price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc. Multi-si price has been USD0.255-0.280/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.305/Pc.
PV cell
The PV cell market boom continued, and the production schedule of first-tier manufacturers could extend until the end of January. Demand for multi-si products in domestic China began to slow down, but there are still some overseas market demand to support the local manufacturers. Mono-si demand was globally buoyant, and it is estimated that this momentum will have a chance to continue till next year.
So far, domestic general multi-si price has remained at RMB0.81-0.88/W. General mono-si price has been maintained at RMB1.00-1.08/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has increased to RMB1.18-1.25/W, with the average price rising to RMB1.20/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at RMB1.20-1.30/W, with the average price rising to RMB1.28/W. Overseas general multi-si price has remained at USD0.102-0.130/W, with the average price growing to USD0.110/W. General mono-si price has remained at USD0.135-0.155/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has increased to USD0.160-0.173/W, with the average price growing to USD0.170/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at USD0.170-0.178/W. Double-sided PV cell price has remained at above RMB1.32/W.
Module
This week the module market maintained stable trading, and the main orders have already been delivered. There were few small quantity orders, making it hard to change the price on the market. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.78-1.85/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.93/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.96/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has remained at RMB2.10-2.20/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) price has remained at above RMB2.22/W. Overseas general multi-si price has remained at USD0.205-0.265/W. High-efficiency multi-si price has remained at USD0.210-0.275/W. General mono-si price has remained at USD0.242-0.360/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at USD0.265-0.380/W.

With the end of the year approaching, market demand in China have gradually come to an end. However, the overseas markets such as Japan and India have been increasing their orders, which could help the market maintain a supply and demand balance in the short term. In the upstream, polysilicon and si-wafer prices are based on volume and are still stable. Product demands and prices of PV cells and modules are different depending on the market. These prices will remain stable unless the balance between supply and demand is broken. During the next one month, in response to the upcoming Chinese New Year, some manufacturers in the supply chain may choose to reduce capacity utilization, but there will also be manufacturers who will continue to produce according to the seasonal demand of other overseas markets. Therefore, although the market as a whole will not change too much, the status of each individual market will still be different.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon trading is not strong this week. Overseas price has fallen this week because the overseas market’s demand is less intense than China’s domestic demand. At present, in terms of the supply side, the old capacity can still maintain normal production, while the new capacity is gradually increasing. The balance between the market’s supply and demand could be maintained when China’s domestic demand was strong. In the future, the supply and demand changes will depend on whether or not the downstream’s high stock up momentum can be maintained. So far, domestic multi-si material price has remained at RMB71-79/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at RMB80-83/KG. Overseas price has been lowered to USD8.20-9.50/KG, with the average price decreasing to USD8.95/KG.
Si-wafer
The previous strong demand of si-wafer has slowed down this week, mainly because domestic demand in China has come to an end. As a result, si-wafer manufacturers have begun to take a wait-and-see attitude, while looking forward to a new wave of market momentum. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at RMB3.05-3.10/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at RMB2.05-2.20/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at RMB2.25/Pc. Overseas mono-si and multi-si wafer prices have not changed. Mono-si wafer price has remained at USD0.380-0.390/Pc. Multi-si price has been USD0.255-0.280/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at USD0.305/Pc.
PV cell
Though demand in China has slowed down, the Japanese and Indian markets have continued to stock up orders, making the PV cell market become buoyant this week. However, because the demand side was more selective to supply and were not subject to price constraints, the price has not changed too much.
So far, domestic general multi-si price has remained at RMB0.81-0.88/W. General mono-si price has been maintained at RMB1.00-1.08/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has increased to RMB1.20-1.25/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has grown to RMB1.23-1.30/W. Overseas general multi-si price has enlarged to USD0.105-0.130/W. General mono-si price has increased to USD0.135-0.158/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at USD0.160-0.173/W, with the average price growing to USD0.172/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at USD0.170-0.178/W. Double-sided PV cell price has reached RMB1.35/W.
Module
There were changes of inventory in the module market this week. The low-priced modules were fully booked in a short time. As the newly produced modules have higher cost, it would be interesting to see whether they will be accepted by the market. In the overseas market, the overall demand is strong, but only manufacturers that have the ability to take up overseas orders will benefit. Small- and medium-sized manufacturers will still be focused on the domestic market.
So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at RMB1.80-1.85/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.93/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at RMB1.83-1.96/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has remained at RMB2.10-2.20/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) price has slightly increased to RMB2.23/W, with a sign of shortage. Overseas general multi-si price has slightly increased to USD0.207-0.265/W. High-efficiency multi-si price has grown to USD0.212-0.275/W. General mono-si price has remained at USD0.242-0.360/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at USD0.265-0.380/W.

After the year-end holiday period and the conclusions of multi-stage tenders, the supply-demand relationship of the whole PV market has been reset and now enters a new adjustment period. Prices in China’s polysilicon market have been corrected downward slightly in response to the price decline in foreign markets. Prices of wafers, cells, and modules have been holding steady, and their courses are expected to remain relatively stable through January and up to the arrival of the Chinese New Year in the beginning of February. If no favorable policies are announced during January, then the optimistic anticipation in the market for policy-driven demand growth might be dampened or extinguished in the near future.
Polysilicon
Trading in the polysilicon market has been muted this week. The price decline in markets outside China in the previous week, together  with efforts by domestic suppliers in reducing excess inventory, have pushed down spot prices slightly in China. However, the overall price trend in China has been stable even as buyers are now negotiating orders for the end of the month. Regarding changes in China’s production capacity, the number of domestic suppliers that still operating has gone down from 24 to 18 this month. However, the country’s total production volume has risen substantially 294,000t a year ago to the current level of 359,000t. Also, more than 90% of China’s domestic demand for mono-Si feedstock can be met by the newly added production capacity. This implies that China’s domestic polysilicon production will gradually substitute foreign imports. For this week, prices of multi-Si feedstock in China have stayed in the range of RMB 72-76/kg, with the average dropping to RMB 74/kg. Price of the mono-Si feedstock in China have stayed in the range of RMB 79-83/kg, with the average falling to RMB 80/kg. Outside China, polysilicon prices (including multi-Si and mono-Si) have not fluctuated noticeably and are now in the range of USD 8.20-9.50/kg.
Wafers
The price trend in the wafer market is stable this week. Also, wafer suppliers are expected to maintain their production as usual during the Chinese New Year period. Since most negotiations in the wafer market for shipment orders in January have already finished, the room for more flexible quotation is limited for additional separate orders. In China, prices of mono-Si wafers are holding in the range of RMB 3.05-3.10/pc, and prices of multi-Si wafers are maintained in the range of RMB 2.05-2.20/pc. The average price of black silicon wafers (which also represents the highest price of multi-Si wafers) have stayed at RMB 2.25/pc in China. Wafer prices have been stable outside China as well, with mono-Si settling in the range of USD 0.380-0.390/pc and multi-Si residing in the range of USD 0.255-0.280/pc. Likewise, the average price of black silicon wafers has been kept at USD 0.305/pc outside China.
Cells
The cell market still enjoys robust demand this week. Regarding high-efficiency mono-Si cells, its market availability is increasingly limited because much of its production is to meet the demand from orders that have been placed in advance. Conversely, the supply-demand relationship in the market for multi-Si cells is stable. Cell prices in China have been constant this week, with conventional multi-Si, conventional mono-Si, high-efficiency mono-Si and superior high-efficiency mono-Si (>21.5%) keeping within the respective ranges of RMB 0.81-0.88/W, RMB 1.00-1.08/W, RMB 1.20-1.25/W, and RMB 1.23-1.30/W. Prices outside China are also holding steady, with conventional multi-Si, conventional mono-Si, high-efficiency mono-Si, and superior high-efficiency mono-Si maintaining in the respective ranges of USD 0.105-0.130/W, USD 0.135-0.158/W, USD 0.160-0.173/W, and USD 0.170-0.178/W. As for bifacial cells, their average price has risen to RMB 1.35/W.
Modules
The module market has slowed down noticeably this week due to the effect of the year-end holiday season in North America and Europe and the conclusions of multi-stage tenders in China. Currently in China, prices of conventional (270-275W) and high-efficiency (280-285W) multi-Si modules are respectively within RMB 1.80-1.85/W and RMB 1.83-1.93/W, while prices of conventional (290-295W) and high-efficiency (300-305W) mono-Si modules are respectively within RMB 1.83-1.96/W and RMB 2.10-2.20/W. The average price of superior high-efficiency modules is also kept at RMB 2.23/W in China. There have been no significant price fluctuations in module markets outside China this week. Thus, prices of conventional and high-efficiency multi-Si modules have been hanging around USD 0.207-0.265/W and USD 0.212-0.275/W, respectively. Meanwhile, prices of conventional and high-efficiency mono-Si modules have been residing within USD 0.242-0.360/W and USD 0.265-0.380/W, respectively.

                                Price Trend: Market Price Was Remained Stable; the Supply End Used CNY Holidays to Adjust Capacity Distribution                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20190110-13059.html,"


This week the multi-si supply chain was considered weaker than that of mono-si. However, market demand still existed for multi-si products. Upstream polysilicon's price in the domestic market of mainland China kept on falling slightly because overseas manufacturers continued selling polysilicon with low prices, so as to consume inventories. Regarding si wafer, the stable balance of supply and demand helped price remain stable. Speaking of PV cell and modules, prices of individual segments rose because of demand. For the rest of PV cell and modules, most of their prices stayed flat.

For the upcoming holidays of Chinese New Year, suppliers will use the time to adjust capacity distribution. This move might help price stably rise.

Polysilicon

This week polysilicon's transactions were the execution of past orders. Even though there were spot deals, these deals were small quantities and their momentum was not concentrated. The two types of prices weren't impressive for two main reasons. First, the new production lines' capacities have steadily ramped up, but old production lines' capacities have not completely phased out. Thus, product prices are expected to fall in the future. Second, overseas manufacturers lowered their product prices, in order to consume inventories. Therefore, domestic prices in China slowly dropped.

When it comes to capacity modification, most of manufacturers already planned to continuously halt production and conduct inspection and maintenance after Chinese New Year Holidays. This wave of production pause is expected to last from March and beyond. Currently, Chinese domestic polysilicon price has dropped to 70~73 RMB/KG. The average price of polysilicon there has decreased to 72 RMB/KG. Mono-silicon price in China has been reduced to 78~80 RMB/KG, and its average price has been decreased to 79 RMB/KG. Overseas polysilicon price remained the same, ranging from 8.20 to 9.50 USD/KG.

Silicon Wafer

This week, for si wafer, mono-si wafer supply chain has stayed stronger than that of multi-si wafer. There were a mix of ups and downs in terms of demand for the si wafer segment. On the one hand, Indian and emerging markets' demand still existed for multi-si wafer that is manufactured in mainland China. In addition, before Chinese New Year Holidays, currently multi-si wafer price still hasn't dropped. On the other hand, multi-si demand of domestic market in China indeed was worse this week than that in December 2018. Rumors had that some multi-si wafer foundries might reduce their capacity after Chinese New Year Holidays.

For now, domestic price of mono-si wafer in mainland China has stayed at 3.05~3.10RMB/Pc. Multi-si wafer price has remained at 2.05~2.20RMB/Pc. Black silicon wafer price has been kept at 2.25RMB/Pc. As for international markets, prices of mono-si wafer and multi-si wafer have stayed the same. Mono-si wafer price has been at 0.380~0.390USD/Pc. Multi-si wafer price has been 0.258~0.280USD/Pc. Black silicon products' price has stayed the same as 0.305USD/Pc.

PV cells

This week PV cell demand remained strong for 2 reasons. First, in China, even though part of installation progress for Top Runner Program was delayed and these manufacturers missed the governmental schedule of December 2018, high efficiency mono-si products' production utilization rate remained fully-loaded and there were supply shortage. In view of multi-si PV cells, because a few manufacturers converted their production lines to make mono-si PV cells, mono-si PV cells' total supply became intensified. In the future, the supply adjustment will determine the price trend.

For now, general multi-si PV cell price in domestic market of China has stayed at 0.81~0.88RMB/W. General mono-si PV cell price has slightly risen to 1.01~1.08RMB/W, and its average price has grown to 1.05RMB/W. High efficiency mono-si PV cell's price has remained at 1.20~1.25RMB/W, and its average price has increased to 1.23RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) PV cell price has grown to 1.22~1.33RMB/W, and its average price has risen to 1.30RMB/W.

For overseas markets, general multi-si PV cell price grew to 0.109~0.137USD/W, and its average price rose to 0.112USD/W. General mono-si PV cell price moved up to 0.145~0.160USD/W, and its average price was increased to 0.155USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si PV cell price stayed at 0.160~0.173USD/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) PV cell grew to 0.172~0.175USD/W, and its average price rose to 0.175USD/W. Bifacial PV cell prices rose to 1.36RMB/W.

Modules

This week, the demand of modules was a mix of ups and downs. The demand in mainland China slowed down but overseas demand kept on rising. In China's end-market, the residual demand of Top Runner Program was being fulfilled. The industry in China is getting ready for Chinese New Year Holidays. Therefore, module demand steadily slowed down. In regard to overseas markets, in some regions, there were still continuous installations and deliveries. In other words, the supply and demand in overseas markets were considered stable.

For now, general multi-si (270W~275W) module price in the domestic market of China has stayed at 1.80~1.85RMB/W, and high-efficiency multi-si (280~285W) module price has remained at 1.83~1.93RMB/W. General mono-si (290~295W) module price has been kept at 1.83~1.96RMB/W, and its average price has risen to 1.92RMB/W. Regarding high-efficiency mono-si (300~305W) module price has grown to 2.15~2.30RMB/W, and its average price has risen to 2.25RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) module price has been kept above 2.25RMB/W.

International markets' general multi-si module prices were stayed at 0.207~0.265USD/W, and its average price slightly rose to 0.214USD/W. High-efficiency multi-si module price remained at 0.212~0.275USD/W. General mono-si module prices stayed at 0.247~0.360USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si module price remained at 0.265~0.380USD/W, and its average price slightly rose to 0.277USD/W.

This week the market demand has been steadily growing. For the upstream polysilicon and si wafer segments, the balance of supply and demand has sustained the stable prices. Meanwhile, their orders will last after Chinese New Year (CNY) Holidays. Regarding PV cells and modules, individual products' demand might guide price to go upwards. In particular, tier-one integrators' orders might steadily last until the end of 1Q19. In 2019, CNY holidays are coming. The news that capacity is all booked might be good news to the industry. If beneficial policies can last, that will be a good sign for the year of 2019.
Polysilicon 
This week, polysilicon's transactions are busier than that in previous duration. There are some price fluctuations in the market and these changes didn't exist earlier. Some buyers have ordered for February. At the same time, polysilicon's inventories are below normal levels, but prices have not risen yet. In the future, downstream demand will last. This factor has indirectly triggered polysilicon's prices to increase. Speaking of capacity adjustment, the new capacities have kept on increasing. The monthly supply quantity after CNY holidays might go above 32 K tons. Currently, in China, polysilicon price has stayed at 70~73RMB/KG. Mono-silicon price has been reduced to 78~81RMB/KG. The international prices have stayed the same at 8.20~9.50USD/KG.
Si wafer
This week, si wafer demand has been similar to that of upstream polysilicon demand. Huge volume of orders will be delivered after CNY holidays. For now, prices have remained constant and there has been a balance between supply and demand. This week China's domestic mono-si wafer prices have stayed at 3.05~3.10RMB/Pc, and multi-si wafer prices have remained at 2.05~2.20RMB/Pc. Black silicon product's prices stayed at 2.25RMB/Pc. When it comes to mono-si and multi-si wafer prices in international markets, their price ranges have remained the same. Mono-si wafer prices have been 0.380~0.390USD/Pc. Multi-si wafer prices have been 0.258~0.280USD/Pc. Black silicon products have stayed the same at 0.305USD/Pc.
PV cells
This week, the PV cell market has been on fire. The transaction volume has been huge. Orders have been scheduled to be fulfilled by the end of 1Q19. In China, some domestic high efficiency PV cell supply has intensified or has been in shortage. Thus, in the overseas market, high efficiency PV cell capacities have seen higher utilization rates.
For now, in China's domestic demand, general multi-si PV cell prices have been moved up to 0.88~0.90RMB/W. General mono-si PV cell prices have remained at 1.01~1.08RMB/W. High efficiency mono-si PV cell prices have been increased to 1.23~1.28RMB/W, and its average price has grown to 1.25RMB/W. Prices of ultra-high efficiency mono-si PV cell (>21.5%) have been adjusted upwards to 1.23~1.34RMB/W, and its average price has risen to 1.31RMB/W.

The overall market continued to maintain a stable pattern this week. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer manufacturers have regulated capacity to stabilize prices, and there has been requests for quotation after Chinese New Year (CNY). PV cell and module markets are in the final stages of order delivery and stocking due to the upcoming CNY holiday. Overall, the supply chain is estimated to remain active during the CNY holiday, but the state of supply and demand after the holiday is not yet clear and will depend on the actual operating conditions.
Polysilicon
As most of the orders have been extended beyond the CNY holiday, polysilicon trading was quite weak this week, with only a few scattered orders. The price movement space was therefore very limited. So far, domestic multi-si material price has remained at 70-74RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has been adjusted to 78-80RMB/KG. Overseas price has remained at 8.20-9.50USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the si-wafer market’s situation is similar to last week. With the upcoming CNY holiday, manufacturers’ pre-stock action for the subsequent demand was not obvious, mainly follow the upstream footsteps. Manufacturers were more concerned about the market changes after CNY holiday, but the increase or decrease of the price has not yet been known. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at 3.05-3.10RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 2.05-2.20RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.25RMB/Pc. Overseas mono-si and multi-si wafer prices have not changed. Mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.380-0.390USD/Pc. Multi-si price has been 0.261-0.280USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 0.305USD/Pc.
PV cell
Trading conditions in the PV cell market have been slightly stable this week. Demand for overseas multi-si PV cell is still rising due to pre-New Year stock requirements; for mono-si, there was no change and the demand was steady. So far, domestic general multi-si price has remained at 0.89-0.90RMB/W. General mono-si price has remained at 1.01-1.08RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been maintained at 1.23-1.28RMB/W.

                                Price Trend: Si-wafer Price Increases at the End of the Year, Positive Momentum Expected after CNY                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20190131-13309.html,"


With the arrival of Chinese New Year (CNY), the market began to show a festive atmosphere and started to slow down. Yet, the price of si-wafer increased at the end of the year, implying that the price movements after CNY will be positive. The supply and demand of upstream polysilicon continued to be stable, while both mono-si and multi-si wafer prices went up at the same time. With the upcoming CNY, PV cell and module manufacturers have arranged leave or scheduled production plans, and are temporarily unaffected by the sudden rise in upstream prices. The overall supply chain is expected to show strong momentum after CNY.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon trading has been reduced in response to the upcoming CNY holidays. Both the first-tier and second-tier manufacturers are looking forward to the strengthening trend after CNY. Orders for February have largely been signed, and there have even been some signs of orders for March. So far, the domestic multi-si material price has been 71-74RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at 78-80RMB/KG. Overseas price has remained at 8.20-9.50USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the price of si-wafer increased ahead of the CNY holidays. GCL and CMC have both increased their prices. The rise before CNY suggests that manufacturers are anticipating strong market momentum after CNY. Thus, the trend after CNY is expected to be positive. So far, domestic mono-si price has been adjusted to 3.05-3.25RMB/Pc, with the average price increasing to 3.18RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 2.05-2.15RMB/Pc, with the average price increasing to 2.12RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.25RMB/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has been 0.385-0.428USD/Pc, with the average price increasing to 0.405USD/Pc. Multi-si price has been 0.265-0.305USD/Pc, with the average price increasing to 0.271USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 0.305USD/Pc.
PV cell
This week, PV cell trading entered a closed state due to the upcoming holiday. Overseas multi-si PV cell demand still depended on the stock up orders of India. For mono-si, there were few changes on each market. So far, domestic general multi-si price has remained at 0.89-0.90RMB/W. General mono-si price has remained at 1.00-1.08RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been maintained at 1.21-1.28RMB/W, with the average price increasing to 1.26RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has grown to 1.25-1.34RMB/W, with the average price remaining at 1.31RMB/W.

Although this week’s orders have been completed before Chinese New Year (CNY), due to the benefit of price increase for si-wafer before CNY, price increased this week. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer benefited from this trend, and the prices slightly rose; the increase in PV cell and module prices still depended on individual products. According to the following trend of overall market, overseas multi-si products were still supported by demands from India and Japan, and although the demand for high-efficiency mono-si products in China was temporarily over, with mono-si product price–performance ratio being more and more favored by the market, the trend is expected to be optimistic, and it will increase the overall solar market product level.
Polysilicon
Affected by the increase after CNY, domestic mono-si and multi-si material prices increased slightly. So far, domestic multi-si material price has slightly grown to 71-77RMB/KG, with the average price rising to 74RMB/KG; mono-si material price has changed to 78-85RMB/KG, with the average price rising to 80RMB/KG.

This week, the overall market maintained a neutral positive pattern. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer prices were adjusted by the fluctuation of supply and demand, but after this correction, in the next month they will likely change again due to changes in supply and demand. For PV cell and module market, the wait-and-see attitude has become stronger, and manufacturers aren’t likely to place orders until the last minute. According to the following trend of overall market, as the weather gradually benefited the construction of system power stations, as long as the supply side hasn’t changed too much, the market’s trading atmosphere will still be neutral and positive. As the second quarter begins, the demand from major demand countries is expected to once again push the market to another climax.
Polysilicon
This week, the polysilicon market atmosphere showed a wait-and-see pattern. The trading market still relied on downstream momentum to drive the demand for polysilicon. The new capacity in China will be gradually released in the next month, and with the restart of overseas maintenance production line, it will cause pressure to the supply. So far, the overall domestic and overseas polysilicon average price hasn’t changed. The domestic multi-si material price has been 73-77RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has been 79-83RMB/KG. Overseas price has remained at 8.20-9.50USD/KG.
Si-wafer
Due to the price increase of major si-wafer manufacturers, the major mono-si manufacturers which routinely quote at the end of the month are bound to be followed by market expectations. The price of multi-si camp was still supported by an out-of-stock situation under a shortage of production. So far, the overall domestic and overseas average price hasn’t changed. Domestic mono-si price has remained at 3.05-3.25RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 2.05-2.20RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.30RMB/Pc.

PV cell
Supply and demand in the PV cell market changed slightly this week. The domestic demand for high-efficiency products was no longer as urgent as in the previous weeks. Besides, with the new capacity of the first-tier manufacturers, the balance between supply and demand was affected. Multi-si PV cell market was still supplied by first-tier manufacturers, and small- and medium-sized manufacturers didn’t have orders to restart capacity. So far, the overall domestic and overseas average price hasn’t changed. Domestic general multi-si price has remained at 0.89-0.92RMB/W. General mono-si price has remained at 1.01-1.08RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been maintained at 1.21-1.28RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has grown to 1.32-1.35RMB/W.

Module
The atmosphere of module market was roughly the same as that of the PV cell. Compared with overseas orders, the domestic demand hasn’t changed much. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at 1.78-1.85RMB/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at 1.83-1.93RMB/W.

This week, the market still showed an atmosphere of slowing demand, and the change in stock-up momentum may be a warning for price fluctuation. Upstream polysilicon’s new capacity filled the demand in the downstream; the demand for si-wafer continued to be strong, but there was an atmosphere of slowing demand in the downstream. The trend of PV cell price was sluggish due to the adjustment of overall demand. The module market remained silent and didn’t place orders until the last moment. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, the demand is expected to be affected. The new demand policy in China hasn’t yet been seen, and the middle of the waiting is bound to affect the demand and price trends of the entire year.
Polysilicon
This week, the polysilicon market was stagnant. Although the downstream si-wafer price increased, the new capacity of polysilicon has been released. In addition, polysilicon production in February hit a new high. The current supply and demand relationship is in a stable stage. This week, only domestic multi-si material price changed, with the range of 72-75RMB/KG and unchanged average price of 73RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at 79-83RMB/KG. Overseas price has remained at 8.20-9.50USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, overseas price on the si-wafer market grew due to exchange rate, but only for overseas mono-si wafer price. The shortage of mono-si hasn’t been solved, but there was a tendency to slow down, which is estimated to be related to decreasing demand; the supply and demand of multi-si were stable and flat. So far, domestic mono-si price has remained at 3.10-3.25RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 2.05-2.20RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.30RMB/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has increased to 0.405-0.450USD/Pc, with the average price rising to 0.419USD/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 0.277-0.295USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 0.310USD/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the PV cell market was the same as last week, and demand momentum continued to slow down. There has been hesitation about the acceptability of high-efficiency product prices, perhaps a warning of the precursor of price reduction. So far, domestic prices haven’t changed. General multi-si price has remained at 0.89-0.93RMB/W. General mono-si price has remained at 1.01-1.08RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been maintained at 1.21-1.28RMB/W.

This week, the overall market entered the traditional low season as the expected demand slowed down, and the stock-up momentum of the entire supply chain was lower than expected. For upstream polysilicon, mono-si remained stable, while multi-si declined. Because the demand continued to slow down, the gap between mono-si and multi-si will be particularly obvious. The trend of si-wafer was similar to upstream polysilicon, and multi-si price decreased first. PV cell and module prices dropped, reflecting the actual situation of the overall market. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, in the next 1-2 months, the market will enter into the first low season of this year, which may require additional policies in order to facilitate large integrated plants and minimize the idle costs produced by the overall enterprise during the low season.
Polysilicon
This week, the gap between mono-si and multi-si individual prices in the polysilicon market have gradually expanded. Mono-si material price was affected due to slow demand. As the decrease of demand for multi-si material was faster than mono-si material, the prices of multi-si material can be affected more easily. Domestic multi-si material price has been 68-72RMB/KG, with the average price dropping to 70RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at 79-83RMB/KG. Overseas price has remained at 8.20-9.50USD/KG, but it needs to be observed afterward.
Si-wafer
This week, for si-wafer market, owing to the slow downstream demand, the stock-up momentum was affected, and there were different changes for mono-si and multi-si products. Although the demand for mono-si has slowed down, the overall supply and demand can also allow prices to show a stable flat trend; in addition to the small demand for multi-si, the market conditions also increased the pressure of price reduction for multi-si. So far, only Chinese multi-si price has changed. Domestic mono-si price has remained at 3.10-3.25RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has decreased to 2.05-2.10RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 2.08RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has been lowered to 2.20RMB/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.405-0.450USD/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 0.277-0.295USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has dropped to 0.310USD/Pc.
PV cell
This week, as demand momentum continued to slow down, the overall PV cell market quote was quite unstable. For multi-si product, because the stock up orders in the overseas markets have ended, there were inventory and price reduction pressures. Due to slow demand, the market quote of mono-si also showed major fluctuations.
The following are prices for the domestic market:

General multi-si price has dropped to 83-0.90RMB/W, with the average price decreasing to 0.87RMB/W
General mono-si price has dropped to 00-1.05RMB/W, with the average price decreasing to 1.02RMB/W

Double-sided PV cell price has remained at 27-1.33RMB/W

Module
This week, the module market felt the most obvious demand slowdown. Overseas multi-si module weakened owing to the end of the installation tide. Some of the markets with the original use of multi-si gradually accepted the conversion of mono-si products. Because double-sided products gradually spread to overseas and domestic markets, it is estimated that the demand for multi-si module will be significantly impacted.
The following are prices for the domestic market:

This week, the market saw both upward and downward price movements; the unstable price movements are a result of the slowdown of expected demand and the growth of the supply side’s inventory level. The overall supply chain is still based on the trend of major manufacturers, and the current market price trend tends to drop slowly. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, large integrated plants will ease the pressure of increased inventory costs with their own resources deployment. The market demand side may still depend on China’s domestic market changes in order to determine the future trend.
Polysilicon
This week, the situation for the overseas and domestic polysilicon markets were different. For overseas market, the main supply was high-purity mono-si material. The price remained unchanged after Chinese New Year, and there have been trading price fluctuations since last week. Domestic prices were at the bottom line, and both mono-si and multi-si material prices decreased.

Overseas price has increased to 9.60-11.50USD/KG, with the average price growing to 9.85USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, due to the slowing demand, mono-si and multi-si inventory levels began to rise. The bargaining space of massive procurement relatively increased. The first-tier manufacturers said that this month’s supply was sufficient. The shortage condition was not as obvious as the previous weeks. So far, domestic mono-si price has been 3.05-3.25RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 3.14RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 2.05-2.10RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has been lowered to 2.15RMB/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.405-0.450USD/Pc. Multi-si price has decreased to 0.265-0.295USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has dropped to 0.305USD/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the PV cell market also began to show signs of rising inventories, while market prices were different depending on the product category. So far, domestic general multi-si price has declined to 0.83-0.88RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 0.85RMB/W. General mono-si price has been lowered to 0.95-1.03RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 1.00RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been maintained at 1.15-1.27RMB/W, with the average price surprisingly growing to 1.25RMB/W.

Double-sided PV cell price has remained at 1.23-1.31RMB/W.
Module
This week, the module market continued to stabilize. Domestic full series of products did not change too much, mainly owing to the lack of obvious demand. For the overseas market, mono-si decreased and multi-si increased. Mono-si price reduction can be attributed to weak demand. For multi-si, because the supply side gradually shrank, suppliers were also limited. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at 1.78-1.85RMB/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been 1.83-1.88RMB/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has been 1.83-1.94RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has been 2.05-2.10RMB/W.

                                Price Trend: Market Conditions at Home and Abroad Are at Odds due to the New Tax System and Exchange Rate Changes                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20190328-13637.html,"


This week’s overall market price volatility was not entirely reflected in the continued slowdown in demand. There were influences of external environmental factors, including the exchange rate and the new tax system. The real market prices have yet to be known after the actual response next week. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer prices showed diverging trends at home and abroad: in the domestic market, the decline could be attributed to the impact of the tax system, while the increase in the overseas market can be attributed to changes in the exchange rate. Downstream PV cell and modules reflected the current market’s supply and demand situation. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, before the arrival of new demand, manufacturers with advantages will remain static. Yet, there will be ineffective capacity which can’t keep up with the changes in market demand. As demand begins to warm up, it also means that these manufacturers will have to make a choice.
Polysilicon
This week, the polysilicon market was still different at home and abroad. Overseas high-purity mono-si material price still maintained a certain gap with domestic price. In addition to exchange rate changes, manufacturers thought that their own materials valued for money and the price after tax rate conversion was comparable to domestic mono-si material price. Domestic prices dropped, regardless of mono-si or multi-si material. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been 63-69RMB/KG, with the average price dropping to 68RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has been 75-81RMB/KG, with the average price dropping to 78RMB/KG. Overseas price has increased to 9.60-11.80USD/KG, with the average price growing to 10.01USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the si-wafer market also showed an external rise and internal decline situation. Prices from the first-tier manufacturers reflected market changes. The previous exchange rate change and the price difference balance between home and abroad were also the main factors behind the consideration for adjustment. Although there was a gap between the proportion of overseas and domestic sales, adjusting price was conducive to manufacturers’ subsequent layout planning. So far, domestic mono-si price has been 3.05-3.15RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 3.08RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has been 2.00-2.08RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 2.06RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has been lowered to 2.10RMB/Pc. Overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.405-0.450USD/Pc, with the average price growing slightly to 0.420USD/Pc. Multi-si price has decreased to 0.261-0.270USD/Pc, with the average price dropping to 0.265USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has decreased to 0.300USD/Pc.
PV cell
This week, the market price of PV cell dropped. As the VAT is about to be revised next month, it is estimated that the current market price has not been able to reflect the actual demand in a timely manner. Due to module demand, overseas mono-si PV cell usage volume still remained stable. Besides, for the US market demand, PV cell stock-up in Southeast Asia and Taiwan was indirectly boosted. So far, domestic general multi-si price has declined to 0.81-0.90RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 0.84RMB/W. General mono-si price has remained at 0.95-1.03RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been 1.21-1.25RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 1.23RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has decreased to 1.22-1.29RMB/W, with the unchanged average price of 1.26RMB/W. Overseas general multi-si price has remained at 0.115-0.130USD/W. General mono-si price has been 0.125-0.135USD/W, with the average price dropping to 0.130USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been 0.155-0.160USD/W, with the average price dropping to 0.158USD/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has been 0.158-0.190USD/W, with the unchanged average price of 0.175USD/W. Double-sided PV cell price has been 1.24-1.30RMB/W.
Module
This week, the module market price has been revised with product and regional demand. The full ranges of products in the overseas market have not changed too much, only slight reduction for multi-si product. Price in the domestic market was lowered slightly. So far, domestic general multi-si (270-275W) price has been 1.73-1.80RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 1.78RMB/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has been 1.83-1.87RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 1.85RMB/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has been 1.83-1.90RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 1.87RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has been 1.95-2.03RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 2.00RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) price has been 2.05-2.15RMB/W, with the average price dropping to 2.10RMB/W. Overseas general multi-si price has remained at 0.210-0.275USD/W, with the average price dropping to 0.221USD/W.

This week, the overall market price is still relatively low. Despite the slowdown in demand, the capacities of some products have remained high. Upstream polysilicon and si-wafer reflected the sense of powerlessness between the current supply and demand in the market, and price has continued to drop slowly. Downstream PV cell and module prices had a mixed phenomenon of increase and decrease, and it is estimated to be related to the needs of a particular product or region. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, with the arrival of spring and new installation period, if China fails to see effective policy guidelines, it is estimated that overseas demand will emerge in the future two to three weeks.
Polysilicon
This week, the market price of polysilicon continued to decline. Both mono-si and multi-si material transaction prices changed due to a slowdown in downstream si-wafer demand. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been 61-65RMB/KG, with the unchanged average price of 63RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has dropped to 68-78RMB/KG, with the average price decreasing to 74RMB/KG. Overseas price has remained at 8.50-11.50USD/KG, with the unchanged average price of 9.90USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, si-wafer overseas price was steady and Chinese price slightly fell. Downstream PV cell manufacturers’ stock was abundant. It is estimated that the stock-up momentum this month was weak. Under the stability of price, the production and marketing were temporarily balanced. So far, overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.405-0.425USD/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 0.258-0.270USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 0.300USD/Pc.
Domestic mono-si price has been lowered to 2.97-3.15RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 3.06RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has decreased to 1.90-2.00RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 1.96RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has been reduced to 2.05RMB/Pc.
PV cell
This week, PV cell overseas price was temporarily stable, while Chinese price continued to drop. Multi-si product was affected by the stock-up momentum from India and Japan, and mono-si product was affected by Europe’s high-efficiency PV cell demand and the start-up demand in the US, which indirectly drove the PV cell capacity utilization rates in the third-party countries.
So far, overseas general multi-si price has remained at 0.115-0.129USD/W. General mono-si price has remained at 0.125-0.135USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at 0.155-0.170USD/W.

This week, the overall market price began to show both upward and downward trends. Regardless of the upstream polysilicon or downstream module, due to different factors, overseas and domestic markets were different. The price range tended to shrink, and the change in average prices was no longer significant. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, so far, the order visibility has been less than one month, mainly for overseas emerging markets. The traditional overseas market has started to stock up. It is estimated that after a few weeks, China’s domestic demand will warm up, and the next momentum will be more obvious.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon market price began to show both upward and downward trends. The price range gradually narrowed, but the average price almost remained unchanged. There were signs that market prices began to express an incorrect message between supply and demand. Different trading objects and content will affect the market price trend. So far, domestic multi-si material price has been 59-65RMB/KG, with the average price remaining at 63RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has grown to 73-76RMB/KG, with the average price increasing to 75RMB/KG. Overseas price has decreased to 8.88-11.29USD/KG, with the average price dropping to 9.79USD/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the si-wafer market also had mixed price movements. For the multi-si market, demand was higher than supply, but the price did not reflect the problem of uneven supply and demand. The main reason was that the manufacturers who can provide capacity were originally lacking in the state. For mono-si market, it was flat and stable, but some PV cell manufacturers began to convert the application of large-size si-wafer. Thus, the spread of the two at the same time mixed into the transaction price, resulting in the increase of mono-si price. So far, overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.405-0.425USD/Pc. Multi-si price has decreased to 0.250-0.260USD/Pc, with the average price dropping to 0.253USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has declined to 0.280USD/Pc.

Black silicon product price has increased to 2.13RMB/Pc.
PV cell
This week, overseas PV cell market continued to stabilize, while there was a mixture of increased and decreased prices for the domestic market. 325W (general multi-si) and 300-305W (high-efficiency mono-si) PV cells are in short supply, resulting in out-of-stock phenomenon, mainly for the supply of overseas emerging markets. So far, overseas general multi-si price has remained at 0.115-0.129USD/W. General mono-si price has dropped to 0.121-0.128USD/W, with the average price falling to 0.125USD/W.

Prices this week (21-28 April) have been much more stable compared with the previous week. While prices of products within different sections of the supply chain continue to fluctuate and diverge in trajectories, the differences have become less significant. The global PV market as a whole still sees slacking demand and is waiting for signs and events that could trigger new waves of stock-up activities. Looking ahead, the overseas emerging markets will constitute the main source of demand in the global PV market in the short term. However, demand in the overseas established markets is also expected to pick up later in the near future, and the momentum there also warrants some attention. China's domestic demand will be influenced by the country’s latest series of policies. Although the latest policies do not give clear indications on the actual demand, the market is interpreting them favorably and will become more active as a result.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon prices have come out steady this week, reflecting a stable balance in the overall supply-demand situation. Polysilicon suppliers are currently entering their maintenance cycle. After a previous incident experienced by a major supplier, much attention has been paid to ensure adequate maintenance and site safety. While the increased prudence on the part of suppliers is bearing some influence on the overall production, there is also sufficient demand to support the market and keep it stable. In China, prices of polysilicon for multi-Si products have been corrected to the range of RMB 59-63/kg (averaging at RMB 63/kg). Prices of polysilicon for mono-Si products have been corrected to the range of RMB 73-76/kg (averaging at RMB 75/kg). Prices in the overseas market have come to the range of USD 8.88-10.27/kg, and their average has gone down to USD 9.78/kg.
Wafer
The wafer market as a whole has not shown significant changes and variations in prices this week. However, the price trend in the multi-Si segment has reflected a lack of confidence in the strength of demand for multi-Si products. While the mono-Si segment is seeing demand growth, prices vary depending on product specifications. In overseas markets, prices of mono-Si and multi-Si wafers have come to the ranges of USD 0.405-0425/pc and USD 0.250-0.260/pc respectively. The average price of the black silicon wafers has been maintained at USD 0.280/pc this week. Prices of mono-Si wafers in China have been corrected to the range of RMB 2.97-3.15/pc this week, and their average has been maintained at RMB 3.08/pc. Prices of multi-Si wafers in China have stayed in the range of RMB 1.90-2.00/pc, with their average dropping to RMB 1.93/pc. As for black silicon wafers, their average price in China has gone up to RMB 2.13/pc this week.
Cell
Cell prices have also been relatively stable this week, but price trajectories of individual products diverge due to their respective demand. On the whole, cell demand from overseas markets has been greater than that of China. In overseas markets, prices of conventional multi-Si cells have been kept in the range of USD 0.115-0.129/W this week. Prices of conventional mono-Si cells have been within USD 0.121-128/W, while prices of high-efficiency mono-Si cells have come to the range of USD 0.160-0.165/W (with their average rising to USD 0.162/W).

With the release of domestic policy and the arrival of holiday after the announcement, the overall market looked forward to the start of work after the holiday. Upstream polysilicon price continued to rise this week after last week’s rebound; the shortage of raw materials for si-wafer continued to expand, seemingly influenced by downstream PV cell; although downstream PV cell and module price didn’t increase completely, they were expected to develop differently after the holiday. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, overseas market can feel the deferred effect of domestic policy after releasing. Traditional and emerging markets can benefit from this. After the release of domestic policy, there will be momentum after the holiday. It is estimated that this momentum will continue until 2H19.
Polysilicon

This week, the overall market atmosphere focused on the project content of domestic policy. The purchase standard of end-system manufacturers is based on the price-performance ratio which will be indicated with grid-parity. The interaction between the upstream polysilicon and si-wafer sectors is getting strained. The reduction of polysilicon supply and the decrease of the existing inventory of si-wafer were the cause of tension. So far, downstream PV cell and module price trends have been unpredictable because of the need for time to digest the policy content and the future product layout for manufacturers. It is estimated that at the end of this month, changes in the trend of products will gradually become clear. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, the overseas market will continue to promote the progress of the installed capacity of each region. In terms of future product layout changes in the market, the price trend will be determined by the actual supply of product content.
Polysilicon
This week, polysilicon market price continued to maintain a slow warming pattern. In May, major manufacturers entered routine maintenance. The overall supply maintained about 22,000 tons, which was less than 20% production capacity compared to last month.

The US in overseas market has been affected by the trade war, and the quote returned to 0.40USD/W. So far, overseas general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at 0.210-0.260USD/W. High-efficiency multi-si (280-285W) price has remained at 0.218-0.227USD/W. General mono-si (290-295W) price has remained at 0.231-0.251USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) price has remained at 0.268-0.348USD/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) price has been 0.278-0.40USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.285USD/W. Domestic price hasn’t been affected by overseas price. Domestic general multi-si price has remained at 1.70-1.75RMB/W. High-efficiency multi-si price has remained at 1.80-1.85RMB/W. General mono-si price has remained at 1.83-1.90RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at 2.05-2.10RMB/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si price has remained at 2.10-2.20RMB/W.

This week, the overall market atmosphere continued last week’s exhibition craze. In the upstream, the overseas sales of silicon material are still being affected by the exchange rate. However, in the other sectors of the supply chain, the situation is more stable, and many are looking forward to favorable trading opportunities. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, China’s 630 installation rush may bring a small peak to the market, and it is estimated to be fermented in the next two to three weeks. For the overseas market, there will be a lot of choices for Chinese manufacturers. The overall market is expected to be prosperous all the way to the end of the year.
Polysilicon
This week, the market price of polysilicon continued to stabilize, with the atmosphere of increasing. For mono-si material, because the supply was not yet fully in place, and the actual demand was greater than the current supply, the price was steady. For multi-si material, although the inventory level was low, the supply could still undertake the actual demand, and the stability of price was better than mono-si material. So far, domestic multi-si material price has remained at 60-65RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at 72-78RMB/KG. Overseas price has been 9.50-10.01USD/KG, with the average price changing to 9.67USD/KG due to the exchange rate. Global average price has dropped to 9.43USD/KG due to the exchange rate and overall price change.
Si-wafer
This week, for the si-wafer market, the demand was greater than supply. The inventory level of mono-si was close to zero, but there was a wait-and-see attitude towards downstream PV cell manufacturers. The atmosphere of price increase continued to ferment, and the market will not stock up until the last minute. For multi-si, due to the lack of hype, the supply could not meet the demand, and it could still be supported by price. So far, overseas mono-si wafer price has been 0.415-0.425USD/Pc, with the average price remaining at 0.420USD/Pc and large size price of 0.475USD/Pc. Multi-si price has been 0.244-0.250USD/Pc, with the average price remaining at 0.253USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has slightly decreased to 0.280USD/Pc. Domestic mono-si price has been 2.97-3.15RMB/Pc, with the average price remaining at 3.12RMB/Pc and large size price of 3.25RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has been 1.86-1.95RMB/Pc, with the average price remaining at 1.91RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.15RMB/Pc.
PV Cell
This week, PV cell market price was affected by upstream shortage. Although there were stock-up demands and capacity expansions, the price was still stable. For mono-si, the call for higher prices from major manufacturers did not boost the market, perhaps due to the supply and demand issue mentioned earlier. Overall, there was only a small price increase for a few products. In the domestic multi-si market, the manufacturers have enlarged the price range due to the larger room for price negotiations. So far, overseas general multi-si price has remained at 0.115-0.129USD/W. General mono-si price has been 0.118-0.160USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.125USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been 0.155-0.170USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.162USD/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has been 0.157-0.178USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.174USD/W.
Domestic general multi-si price has been 0.86-0.95RMB/W, with the average price remaining at 0.89RMB/W. General mono-si price has been 0.92-0.95RMB/W, with the average price remaining at 0.93RMB/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has been 1.15-1.21RMB/W, with the average price growing to 1.18RMB/W.

Module
This week, the module market price continued to be steady. It is estimated that the module’s reaction cycle is one or two weeks after the rise of PV cell price. The US quote has been revised to 0.370USD/W. The previous quote included the delivery price. So far, overseas general multi-si (270-275W) price has been 0.205-0.260USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.220USD/W.

This week, the market still had a wait-and-see atmosphere. Affected by the downstream si-wafer’s tight demand, upstream polysilicon price became unstable. Currently, the industry’s si-wafer inventory is still relatively low, and the overall PV cell production is still rising. The activity in the module market has not been as strong as expected. In terms of the subsequent overall market trend, domestic market transactions will continue to warm up. Although they are slow, the market confidence will not be affected. The overseas market has yet to show signs of explosive growth, but the overall demand and installed capacity will continue to increase. As bifacial PV modules have been excluded from the Section 201 tariffs, their future impact will be worth observing.
Polysilicon
This week, the market price of polysilicon was unsteady compared to last week. Downstream demand for mono-si material continued to heat up. There were rumors that mono-si wafer manufacturers were out of stock. The lower limit of the mainstream market quotation was gradually increased. Low-cost resources were increasingly reduced. If mono-si material continues to be out of stock, multi-si material is likely to be adopted. Yet, this statement still depends on the choice of downstream markets. The demand for multi-si material was as strong as mono-si material, but the price could be stabilized, mainly because the supply of multi-si material was more stable compared to mono-si. So far, overseas price has been 9.51-10.02USD/KG, with the average price remaining at 9.67USD/KG. Global average price has remained at 9.43USD/KG. Domestic multi-si material price has remained at 60-65RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has been 73-77RMB/KG, with the average price remaining at 76RMB/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the phenomenon of stock shortage in si-wafer market could not be improved. Although the number of slices was increased, the growth was limited and slow. For multi-si, the supply and demand remained balanced. So far, overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.415-0.425USD/Pc, with large size price of 0.475USD/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 0.244-0.250USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 0.280USD/Pc. Domestic mono-si price has been 3.02-3.17RMB/Pc, with the average price remaining at 3.12RMB/Pc and large size price of 3.35RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 1.86-1.95RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has dropped to 2.14RMB/Pc.
PV Cell
This week, PV cell market price was mixed. For mono-si, there was price tug-of-war between supply and demand. Although there was a large number of supply and actual demand, the real transaction price had to wait until the last minute. Domestic multi-si price is expected to be increased. Yet, slow overseas stock-up momentum in the next month was expected. This week, the US government announced Section 201 related exemption product categories. The bifacial products attracted more public attention. It is expected that overseas bifacial PV cell product-related quote will be updated. So far, overseas general multi-si price has been 0.113-0.129USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.118USD/W. General mono-si price has remained at 0.118-0.160USD/W.

This week, the supply and demand of the overall supply chain became tight. Yet, the individual market condition was different. There were increases and decreases in overseas and domestic prices. For polysilicon, with last week’s demand pressure, prices of products with different categories grew and dropped. For si-wafer, due to the decision-making considerations of the market and the exchange rate, there were different pricing strategies. Downstream PV cell and module prices were based on different regions. Compared with the domestic market, the overseas market’s price change was slow. Subsequently, the market will gradually focus on domestic, especially after the implementation of the relevant policies.
Polysilicon
This week, the market price of polysilicon reflected the current market for different product demands. The demand for mono-si material was strong, making its price grow and indirectly affecting the supply chain. Thus, the capacity of multi-si material was forced to be reduced. Although the actual price declined this week, it is estimated that the follow-up will be reflected in the actual transaction price of the market. Overseas mono-si material price increased owing to the growth in domestic mono-si material demand. So far, overseas price has been 9.53-10.05USD/KG, with the average price growing to 9.69USD/KG. Global average price has remained at 9.43USD/KG. Domestic multi-si material price has been 59-64RMB/KG, with the average price dropping to 63RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has been 74-77RMB/KG, with the average price remaining at 76RMB/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, due to different changes of overseas and domestic markets, there were price adjustments in the si-wafer market. For mono-si, due to factors of exchange rate and different demands, two major mono-si wafer manufacturers only adjusted the overseas prices. For multi-si, there were just slight adjustments, and the rise and fall were still predictable. So far, overseas mono-si wafer price has declined to 0.405-0.415USD/Pc, with large size price of 0.465USD/Pc. Multi-si price has been 0.246-0.255USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has dropped to 0.277USD/Pc. Domestic mono-si price has remained at 3.02-3.17RMB/Pc, with large size price of 3.35RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has been 1.85-1.95RMB/Pc, with the average price dropping to 1.90RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.14RMB/Pc.
PV Cell
This week, domestic PV cell price completely dropped. The overseas market hasn’t realized the threat of price reduction, and the price is expected to change next week. The forecast share of mono-si PV cell is expected to rise this year. The main reason is that downstream system manufacturers’ LCOE calculation is conducive to high-power products, especially bifacial products. In terms of the expected growth in the number of installation in emerging countries this year, competitive bidding and grid parity can be approached. So far, overseas general multi-si price has remained at 0.113-0.129USD/W. General mono-si price has remained at 0.118-0.160USD/W. High-efficiency mono-si price has remained at 0.155-0.170USD/W. Ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has remained at 0.157-0.178USD/W.

After a wave of installation peaks in the first half of the year, the overall market atmosphere was stable again. Upstream polysilicon was still experiencing tight demand and short supply. For si-wafer, there were signs of intensifying downstream stock-up momentum and short supply. For downstream PV cell and module, due to the changes of the world’s high and low seasons and the anchoring effects of the domestic bidding projects, the market has begun to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Some overseas markets’ installation temporarily came to an end, and the follow-up demand momentum will still depend on the individual regions. The overall outlook of the domestic market will depend on whether the manufacturers will follow up on the bidding projects. The balance between supply and demand in Q3 is expected to stabilize prices, thus boosting the high season in Q4.
Polysilicon
This week, the polysilicon market was still steady. Affected by the growing demand for mono-si material, the proportion of domestic production of mono-si material gradually increased. In 1H19, the proportion has reached more than 50%, and high-purity mono-si material imported from overseas also grew. For multi-si material, because its demand was less strong, the supply and demand were relatively stable. So far, overseas price has increased to 9.54-10.06USD/KG, with the average price growing to 9.70USD/KG. Global average price has slightly increased to 9.44USD/KG. Domestic multi-si material price has been 60-64RMB/KG, with the average price remaining at 63RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has been 74-78RMB/KG, with the average price remaining at 76RMB/KG.
Si-wafer
This week, the si-wafer market’s price was steady. Mono-si wafer’s demand was higher than supply, and some PV cell manufacturers have considered raising the purchase price to consolidate the supply capacity of upstream si-wafer. For multi-si wafer, although there was demand, due to limited capacity, the overall price could still maintain a balanced situation, and the space of growth was limited. So far, overseas mono-si wafer price has remained at 0.405-0.415USD/Pc, with large size price of 0.460USD/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 0.246-0.255USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 0.277USD/Pc. Domestic mono-si price has remained at 3.02-3.17RMB/Pc, with large size price of 3.35RMB/Pc. Multi-si price has remained at 1.85-1.95RMB/Pc. Black silicon product price has remained at 2.14RMB/Pc.
PV Cell
This week, there were increases and decreases for PV cell market price, but the adjustment range was reasonable. Due to the low season in Q3, the stock-up momentum of downstream module manufacturers slowed down. The whole product category was affected by individual markets to adjust the speed of shipments. So far, overseas general multi-si price has been 0.113-0.127USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.118USD/W.

Module
This week, the difference between the domestic and overseas market for module was quite obvious. Affected by the low season in some regions in Q3 and climate, overseas market price fluctuations were particularly significant. For domestic market, there were more wait-and-see attitudes. The follow-up market effect is expected. So far, overseas general multi-si (270-275W) price has been 0.205-0.250USD/W, with the average price remaining at 0.222USD/W.

This week, the market officially started to experience oversupply. With the arrival of the low season, manufacturers have taken a cautious attitude, and prices between different segments of the supply chain will experience a tug of war as demand continues to decline. For the tug of war between the upstream polysilicon and si-wafers, the situation is relatively minor and stable. There was capacity overhaul in the supply side, and it can slow the tension between supply and demand. For downstream PV cell and module, there was too much inventory accumulation, so the overall market price was affected. If the market's demand can’t be properly maintained, the phenomenon of price reduction will become more obvious. In terms of the supply and demand in the next few weeks, it is difficult to see an optimistic trend; in the future, the prices will continue to be affected by the market’s supply and demand.
Polysilicon
This week, the market price of polysilicon maintained a similar pattern to last week’s trend. Although the overall demand slowed down, mono-si material price was still maintained, and multi-si material price slightly decreased. So far, this month’s orders have been signed at the end of last month. In terms of capacity adjustment, domestic manufacturers have done well, and there was no shortage problem. Yet, the proportion of production of mono-si material has increased month by month, showing that the market demand for mono-si material is still more than multi-si material. Since Q3, overseas major manufacturers have carried out routine maintenance arrangements. Thus, an impact is expected on the demand for high-purity materials. So far, overseas price has dropped to 9.51-10.02USD/KG, with the average price decreasing to 9.68USD/KG. Global average price has dropped to 9.38USD/KG. Domestic multi-si material price has been 60-63RMB/KG, with the average price declining to 62RMB/KG. Mono-si material price has remained at 74-78RMB/KG.
Si-wafer
Trading in the si-wafer market has not changed much this week, mainly due to slowing downstream demand. Mono-si wafer was deeply affected by price reduction, mainly because of the large gap between demands. Multi-si wafer price continued its steady downward trend in the previous weeks. So far, overseas 156.75mm wafer price has remained at 0.415USD/Pc. 158.75mm wafer price has remained at 0.455USD/Pc. 161.75mm wafer price has remained at 0.460USD/Pc. Multi-si price has been 0.244-0.248USD/Pc. Black silicon product price has dropped to 0.275USD/Pc. Domestic mono-si price has been 3.00-3.11RMB/Pc, with large size price of 3.35RMB/Pc.

Bifacial ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>21.5%) price has dropped to 1.19RMB/W.
Module
This week, for module, the difference of market prices at home and abroad was not large, which is mainly reflected in the price reduction of the high-priced products. Demand for end products will still be affected by the slowdown in overall market momentum. So far, overseas general multi-si (270-275W) price has remained at 0.205-0.250USD/W.

                                Trend: Market Transactions Still Bearish, Strong Contrast between the Continuous Shortage of Wafers and the Decline in Cell Prices                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20190718-14576.html,"


The overall market mood is still sluggish, which is typical of the off-peak season. There is not much change on the polysilicon front. The wafers, on the other hand, is in short supply. It is estimated that it has to do with the downstream battery manufacturers' intentions of consolidating the supply of goods. The cell segment continues to decline, and the module is far less affected by the price stress than the PV Cell. Given the changes in supply and demand in the upcoming weeks, a dip in the price is inevitable. The key is whether the price can be maintained until the next wave of high demand, otherwise the market mood will be affected.   
Polysilicon
The market price of polysilicon increased steadily this week. Most of the production capacity is focused on delivering the previous orders. Not many temporary orders have been executed. The new capacity is gradually and steadily replacing the former capacity. The polysilicon currently in market circulation is mainly delivered by the new capacity. The primary focus is to replace the old production capacity with the new to maintain the optimization of cash cost. The range of the overseas price revision is 9.51~10.03USD/KG at the moment, and the average price is lowered to 9.67USD/KG. while the global average price is up to 9.39USD/KG. The price of the multi crystalline materials in the domestic market remain unchanged at 60~63RMB/KG. The mono crystalline materials remain unchanged at 74~78RMB/KG.   
Si-Wafer
The prices of different products in the wafer market are facing rather different situations. The mono-Si wafers are still in short supply. It is mainly due to the downstream cell manufacturers' intentions of consolidating the supply of goods. The multi-Si wafers, on the other hand, have seen their prices crumble as the off-peak season arrives. The original weak demand has not only failed to supported the price, but also led to a decrease in the overall price. The 156.75 mono-si wafers in the overseas market remain unchanged at 0.415USD/Pc, the 158.75mm products remain unchanged at 0.455USD/Pc, and the mono-si wafers with size of 161.75mm and above remain unchanged at 0.460USD/Pc. The price of the multi-Si wafers has been revised to the range between 0.240 and 0.242USD/Pc, The black silicon product price has been reduced to 0.270USD/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers have been increased to 3.05~3.13RMB/Pc, while the large-size products remain unchanged at 3.35RMB/Pc. The price of the multi-Si wafers have been revised to range between 1.85~1.87RMB/Pc. The price of the cast-mono wafers is lowered to 1.92RMB/Pc. The price of the black silicon wafers is reduced to 2.10MB/Pc.   
PV Cell
The inventory of mono-PERC cells in the market continued to rise this week, and the price continued to decline. The market expects that there is still room for the cells to be even lower. Due to the unequitable distribution of information in the market, the cell manufacturers turn out to be the victims of the off-peak season, facing the icy treatments from the upstream as well as the downstream suppliers. It is possible that many small and medium-sized factories, which reactivated their manufacturing capacity, may have to face the difficult choice of whether to shut down the production again. The overseas price of the general multi-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.113~0.127USD/W at the moment. 
The price of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.115~0.145USD/W, The price of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.155~0.172USD/W. The price of the ultra-high efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) remains unchanged at 0.148~0.190USD/W.  In the domestic front, the price of general multi-Si cells is revised to range between 0.81 and 0.84RMB/W, the average price is down to 0.83RMB/W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cells is reduced to 0.87RMB/W, The price of the general mono-Si cells is revised to range from 0.115 to 0.145USD/W, the average price is lowered to 0.84RMB/W, The price of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells is revised to range from 1.05 to 1.07RMB/W, the average price is lowered to 1.06RMB/W. The price of the ultra-high efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) is revised to range from1.12~1.15RMB/W, the average price is lowered to 1.14RMB/W. The price of the double-sided high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at 1.16RMB/W, and the price of the double-sided high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.5%) is up-regulated to 1.20RMB/W. 
Module
The module market is still in a passive state of trading this week. Basically, the module manufacturers will not place orders at the last minute, The decreasing pull from the terminal market, which indirectly forces the module manufacturers to shorten the delivery cycle to the minimum, has also passed on the production pressure to the upstream cell manufacturers at the same time.  In the overseas front, the price of multi-si (270-275W) remains unchanged at 0.205~0.250USD/W,  and the price of multi-si (280-285W) remains unchanged at 0.218~0.235USD/W,  but the average price is lowered to 0.223USD/W,  and the price of the general mono-si (290-295W) remains unchanged. The price of high-efficiency mono-si (300-305W) is revised to range between 0.268 and 0.335USD/W,  the average price remains unchanged at 0.271USD/W, The price of the ultra-high efficiency mono-si (>310W) is revised to range between 0.253 and 0.395USD/W, the average price remains unchanged at 0.280USD/W.

The overall market is still in the off-season and has not improved this week. Both of the domestic and overseas prices of the upstream polysilicon show adjustments and changes. The wafer market is still polarized. The price of the cells continues to drop. It is estimated that there might be changes after August. The module manufacturers are not doing as bad as the cells. However, it may be a make-or-break time for the weaker manufacturers. In the upcoming weeks, if the mood of the market could be reversed by the end of Q3, it would be almost acceptable for the overall PV supply chain. Otherwise, the industry would not shake off the slump easily. The recession would expand both in terms of time and scale, which is not good for the overall market.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon market is still slow and stagnant this week. Other than the fact that the off-season affects business opportunities, the routine maintenance also slightly affects the supply, but not to such an extent that it would change the price. It is estimated that the effects of maintenance would be reflected on the supply around late Q3. There is a possibility that market demand and supply might be out of sync again. There is also a shortage of supply in overseas markets. Although it does not so much cause a fluctuation in the price, it is inevitable that the market will adjust slightly. The range of the overseas price revision is 9.50~10.00USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.66USD/KG, while the global average price is lowered to 9.33USD/KG. The range of the domestic multi polysilicon price is revised to 59~62RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 60RMB/KG, while the mono polysilicon has remained at 74~78RMB/KG.
Si-wafers
This week the mono-Si wafers stay stable, while the poly-Si wafers continue to decline. In order to maintain liquidity, some multi-Si wafer manufacturers are willing to reduce their price so much, that it is close to their cash cost. They even went as far as attracting the customers by the price reduction of the August orders. The market of the mono-Si wafers, on the other hand, remain balanced. Although the price of the downstream cells continue to fall, the two major wafer manufacturers remain stable. In the overseas market, the price of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers has risen to 0.417USD/Pc. The 158.75mm mono-Si wafers has remained at 0.445USD/Pc. The mono-Si wafers with size 161.75mm and above has remained at 0.460USD/Pc.
The range of the multi-Si wafers price revision is 0.238~0.239USD/Pc. The black silicon products are revised down to 0.267USD/Pc. In the domestic market, the mono-Si wafers has remained at 3.05~3.13RMB/Pc. The large-size products has remained at 3.35RMB/Pc. The multi-Si wafers has remained at 1.85~1.87RMB/Pc.
The cast-mono wafers are lowered to 1.90RMB/Pc. The black silicon products are lowered to 2.08RMB/Pc.
Cells
The high level of inventory still leads to the continuous decline in the cell market this week. There is not as much change as expected in terms of the proportion of the manufacturers suspending their production. They keep up the production due to the costs incurred in interrupting and restarting the production lines. The inventory from this wave of production may take 1~ 2 months to digest by estimation. On the multi-Si cell front, the market has not been much affected. Its capacity is not as abundant, therefore its pull on the market price is limited. In the overseas market, the price of the general multi-Si cells has remained at 0.113~0.127USD/W. The average price is revised down to 0.116USD/W. The range of the general mono-Si cell price revision is 0.115~0.140USD/W. The average price has remained at 0.120. USD/W.

Module
This week, the module market continues to maintain stability. A wait-and-watch sentiment is taking hold of the markets. The orders of large manufacturers still continue to deliver their products reliably. For small and medium-sized factories with fewer orders, they have to survive on whatever they can get. In the overseas market, the general multi-Si (270-275W) price has remained at 0.205~0.250USD/W. The high-efficiency multi-Si (280-285W) price has remained at 0.218~0.235USD/W.

The overall market has risen and fallen this week. The supply and demand of each stage also affects the overall trend of the offer price. The price range of the overseas upstream polysilicon is getting bigger, whereas the domestic demand remains relatively stable. The market of the wafers stay as polarized as last week: mono-Si wafers rise as the multi-Si ones fall. The same thing is also happening to the cell price. Every product of the module stage is facing a volatile market. As the price rises and falls, some products are becoming more prominent. The price trend in different regions differ as well. In the future, it does not seem likely that we are on the path to a bullish market. Manufacturers of each stage’s survival depends on whether or not their risk diversification strategy is effective.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon in the domestic and overseas markets show mixed results this week. Although the price of domestic multi polysilicon has dipped slightly, it is within the expected range. As for the mono polysilicon, there has not been much change. The price remains unwavering despite the downstream market. However, the price is on the path of gradual ascent. The highest price is rising and the lowest price is dropping in the overseas markets, mainly due to the routine maintenance of the suppliers and shorter supply.
The range of the overseas price revision is 9.00~10.03USD/KG. The average price is lowered to 9.39USD/KG, while the global average price is lowered to 9.24USD/KG. The range of the domestic multi polysilicon price is revised to 56~62RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 59RMB/KG, while the mono polysilicon has remained at 74~78RMB/KG.
Silicon wafer
This week, the mono-Si wafer market is still unchanged. Although there is excess demand in the market, there is no excessive material available in the market. However, in order to maintain the price difference between the multi-Si wafers and the mono ones, the probability of price increase in the short term is not high. The multi-Si wafer market is expected to decline slightly, mainly because the supply is small and the demand is not high, either. Combining these two factors gives us the price trend in the market today. In the overseas market, the price of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers is slightly lowered to 0.416USD/Pc at the moment. The 158.75mm mono-Si wafers has remained at 0.445USD/Pc. The mono-Si wafers with size 161.75mm and above has remained at 0.460USD/Pc. The range of the multi-Si wafers price revision is 0.237~0.238USD/Pc. The black silicon products are revised down to 0.265USD/Pc. In the domestic market, the mono-Si wafers has remained at 3.05~3.13RMB/Pc at the moment. The large-size products has remained at 3.35RMB/Pc. The range of the multi-Si wafers price revision is 1.84~1.87RMB/Pc. The black silicon products are lowered to 2.06RMB/Pc.
Cell
This week, the overall cell market continues its downward slide. The decline in the domestic market is, however, slowing down. The high-efficiency products with more supply in the market see their price drop. The overseas market plummeted. The product categories in demand are relatively diverse. The price revision range of the complete spectrum of products is rather broad. The level of inventory continued to rise, which is mainly due to weak demand.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision has remained at 0.105~0.127USD/W at the moment. The average price is revised down to 0.111USD/W. The range of the general mono-Si cell price revision is 0.110~0.125USD/W. The average price has been revised down to 0.115USD/W.

Module
This week, the module market sees chaos reign, where the highest offered price is increased, and the lowest decreased. The primary reason behind this is that the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are rather flexible when it comes to offer price in the hopes of getting more orders. Some first-tier manufacturers have yet to feel the pressure to reduce prices. It is estimated that even the major players will be under pressure to reduce price, if the market does not improve.
In the overseas market, the general multi-Si (270-275W) price has remained at 0.205~0.250USD/W. The average price is lowered to 0.220USD/W. The high-efficiency multi-Si (280-285W) price has remained at 0.218~0.235USD/W. The average price is lowered to 0.220USD/W. The general mono-Si (290-295W) price has remained at 0.235~0.251USD/W.

                                PV Products Tending Towards Diversification, with Market Demand to Smooth Out Price Differences                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20190806-14823.html,"

Looking back at the PV market in 2018, we see micro module technologies maturing in development and moving on to mass production, with modules no longer limited to a single design as before, but rather continuing on the path towards diversification in 2019. The same situation is spreading towards and may be glanced from the Si wafer and cell segments at supply chain upstream.
Bifacial (Cell) Modules to Bring About the Next Revolutionary Shift in Production 
As the demand for bifacial modules grows day by day, the demand for its main component, bifacial cells, grows along with it. EnergyTrend, a division of TrendForce, has compiled data to produce a graph showing the price trends of superior high efficiency standard and bifacial cells (>21.5%) in the first half of 2019 (graph 1) for non-Chinese overseas markets (left) and Chinese markets (right).
Graph 1: Price Trends of Superior High Efficiency (>21.5%) Standard and Bifacial Cells Worldwide for 1H19
(Left: Overseas (non-China), USD/W; Right: China, RMB/W)
A comparison of both left and right graphs show that since 98% of all superior high efficiency bifacial cells come from Chinese manufacturers, China’s domestic demand have a convenience advantage over overseas markets (due to being a local market), and prices for superior high efficiency bifacial cells are better able to withstand downward price pressure than overseas markets are. Price trends for superior high efficiency bifacial cells in the first half of 2019 are a 0% change for China’s markets (from 1.31RMB/W to 1.31RMB/W) and a 4.37% decline for other overseas markets (from 0.183USD/W to 0.175USD/W).
From this, we can see that price differences between superior high efficiency standard and bifacial cells will change depending on the balance reached between supply and demand. Demand is high and concentrated in China’s markets, giving quite frequent price fluctuations. Other overseas markets, however, do not require these products as much as China for now, with prices rather stable and fluctuating less frequently as a result. We see that price fluctuations for standard and bifacial products are affected precisely by market acceptance.
Suppliers to Maximize Module Area, with Large-Sized Si Wafers Becoming the Main Focus  
Besides the change in cells as a result of the development of bifacial modules, Si wafer suppliers upstream are bringing up the idea to enlarge Si wafer sizes in hopes of meeting market demand for a higher module output power, possibly achievable through, for example, adjusting cell pitch within module packages.
Around 20 years ago, PV cells were originally mass produced by 4-inch (later extended to 5-inch) fab processes, moving on to become the 156.75 mm x 156.75 mm M-series wafers in 2013. For Si wafer suppliers, large-sized wafers may reduce production costs while raising output power. Suppliers have thus began development of and supply the market with large-sized wafers for this very reason.
The price trends for different Si wafer sizes are quite similar to those for cells mentioned above. Theoretically, different sized wafers will exhibit a difference in price, but demand remains to be the key factor determining market price fluctuations. Judging from the price trends of China’s mono/multi wafers in the first half of 2019, though different-sized wafers necessarily exhibit a difference in initial market price, that difference may be diminished amid tightening demand, as evidenced by the gap between the prices for large-sized and normal wafers in China markets, narrowed as a result of tightening demand in May (as shown in graph 2).
Graph 2: Price Trends of Mono/Multi Wafers Worldwide for 1H19 
 (Left: Overseas (non-China), USD/W; Right: China, RMB/W)
Thus, the price changes in the above two PV products both indicate that buyers have more options when products become more diversified, and that the variables between buyer and seller to consider in shifting market conditions become complicated as a result of that diversification; product prices depend on market demand and market acceptance instead of its own true value.

This week the overall market is still more inactive than actively trading. The overseas price of the upstream polysilicon is declining due to the exchange rate fluctuations, while its domestic price remains stable. The trend of the wafer price is nothing surprising. The price of the cells is also in free fall. The modules are the only PV product that is more or less stable. In the future, the tender and procurement for the development of the ground-mounted projects will be initiated. Although the price is quite close to the cost, the buyers and sellers still have the opportunity to reach a consensus. The overseas market shows a stable and balanced development. There is a chance for the price to stop the plunge and bounce back, as the tenders are finalized, constructions are completed in each region and country.
Polysilicon
Polysilicon has shown different developments in the domestic and overseas markets. The price of domestic polysilicon remains stable. Although the prices are reduced in some transactions, the price reductions have been narrowed. The upstream and downstream balance of power is maintained. The overseas market is affected by large fluctuations of the exchange rate. The overall price is revised downward. In the overseas market, the range of price revision is 8.85~9.86USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.21USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 9.08USD/KG. In the domestic market, the price of polysilicon remains unchanged at 56~62RMB/KG. The mono polysilicon remains unchanged at 74~78RMB/KG.
Silicon wafers
There is not much change in the wafer market this week. The price of mono-Si wafers is still stable. The multi-Si wafers has been slightly revised downward, of which the overall range, however, is not big. While some of the small and medium manufacturers have engaged in price reduction and dumping, the overall market price does not change. In the overseas market, the price of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.416USD/Pc at the moment. The 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remain unchanged at 0.445USD/Pc.

The range of the multi-Si wafers price revision is 1.82~1.85RMB/Pc. The black silicon products remains unchanged at 2.06RMB/Pc.
Cells
The cell market continued its downward spiral. The market price seems to have bottomed out due to the market’s expectation of the lowest point. The range of decline in multi-Si cells is no longer expected to expand. The demand is still weak without a glimmer of hope for recovery. I can't see a glimmer of light. In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is 0.104~0.123USD/W. The average price is revised down to 0.108USD/W. The range of the general mono-Si cell price revision is 0.105~0.115USD/W. The average price is revised down to 0.110USD/ W.

Modules
The modules remain stable in the market, mainly because the uncertain demand affects when the sellers and buyers can come to an agreement. It is a buyer’s market at the moment. The price is expected to drop further. Therefore, the buyers are reluctant to place orders, while the sellers are eager to sell. The time to start the domestic ground-mounted projects is coming. Module manufacturers prefer weighing their options to finalize their procurement out of impulse. In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si (270-275W) price revision is 0.205~0.248USD/W. The average price is lowered to 0.218USD/W.

There was no unexpected development in the overall market this week. The market is still on a “wait-and-see” approach. There may be some changes in prices between different stages of the entire industry chain. It will not, however, affect the subsequent trend of the market price. Looking ahead, it is difficult to see a growing demand and purchase orders in both domestic and overseas markets. As the autumn is approaching and some projects, which are under time pressure, are launched, the dark times should be coming to an end. The moment for the market to rebound is already on the horizon.
Polysilicon
Owing to the fact that the market is still in the strong grip of the “wait-and-see” mood, there is no significant change in the price of polysilicon. The overseas market was affected by the decreasing value of the Chinese renminbi (RMB). Therefore the overall price was revised downward. In the overseas market, the range of price revision is 8.81~9.82USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.14USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 9.03USD/KG. In the domestic market, the price range of polysilicon remains unchanged at 56~62RMB/KG. The price range of the mono polysilicon remains unchanged at 74~78RMB/KG.
Silicon Wafers
Little change has taken place in the wafer market this week. Due to the support of the long-term supply agreements and the absence of individual orders which may influence the price, there is no shortage in the market supply anymore. It is agreed that the price of multi-Si wafers has fallen to the level of the cash cost, which does not afford much room for downward price revision. Plus, the demand is not high. Therefore the overall price is stable. In the overseas market, the price of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.416USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.445USD/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above remains unchanged at 0.460USD/Pc.

The range of the multi-Si wafers price revision is 1.82~1.83RMB/Pc. The black silicon products remain unchanged at 2.06RMB/Pc.
Cell
The cell market seems to be on the path to recovery. There seems to be a consensus regarding the falling streak of the price, i.e. it is not possible that the price would crash below the cash cost. The overall price shows little change. The small and medium-sized manufacturers, in response to the stunted demand, have decreased their production or capacity utilization rate. In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.104~0.123USD/W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.105~0.115USD/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.131~0.150USD/W.

This week the overall market still maintains its wait-and-see approach. There has been less than active trading in the past few weeks. There may be some price changes between the various stages of the industrial value chain. However, it will not affect the subsequent trend of the market price. Looking forward, it is quite obvious that the market is showing signs of a stop in the free fall of the price. Regarding the specific point in time which the price rebound may take place, it will depend on when the demand of each regional market begins to rise in a later time. The later the demand arises, the more pressure the manufacturers would be under during the rush of installations at the end of the year. There would also be more uncertainty surrounding the price.
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon remains stable. The supply and demand are balanced this week. The overall overseas price is revised downwards due to the continuous depreciation of the Chinese renminbi (RMB). The domestic market, however, shows no significant change in demand and supply. The main activities surround the production and delivery of the existing orders. Concerning the capacity utilization, the supply volume in September is expected to be larger than that in August, given that the major manufacturers are adding new capacity and the equipment under regular maintenance will be returned to operate at full capacity. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.80~9.80USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.12USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 9.01USD/KG. In the domestic markets, the price range of polysilicon remains unchanged at 56~62RMB/KG. The price range of the mono polysilicon remains unchanged at 74~78RMB/KG.
Silicon Wafers
The trend in the wafer market still maintains stable this week. Multi-Si wafers are so close to their cash cost, that the price plunge seems to have come to a stop. Although the Mono-Si wafers are in stable demand, only the first-tier manufacturers enjoy the blessings of the long-term supply deals. The small and medium manufacturers are under pressure to sell.

This week the overall market is bottoming out. The price of cells, which suffered the sharpest drop in the past, are no longer falling, at least it seems to have stabilized for the past two weeks. The next step is to see when the demand will rise. The price of the upstream overseas polysilicon is still affected by the exchange rate, which gradually spread to the overseas prices of downstream wafers. The quoted overseas prices of the two major manufacturers are reduced this month, indicating that the mood of the domestic market is still optimistic. The cells and modules continue to wait for their window of opportunity.
In the future, domestic projects are getting evaluated and negotiated. It is estimated that all purchases will be completed before China’s Golden Week Holiday in October. The projects will commence after the holiday. As for the overseas market, numerous projects will show more progress after the hot summer is passed. In particular, the projects that have to be completed this year will increase domestic demand. It is expected that this dynamic will drive the market to flourish.
Polysilicon
The overseas market price of polysilicon is still under the spell of fluctuations of the foreign exchange. The overall price is revised downwards. The domestic market is mainly stable.

Compared with the steady downturn in the past few weeks, the overall market is looking up. The fluctuating prices show signs of improvement. The overseas polysilicon market is mixed, mainly due to changes in the downstream demand: regarding wafers, the mono-Si wafers maintains its price stability, while the price of its multi-Si counterparts is sliding. The cells and modules maintain their existing trend. However, the inventory level of the manufacturers seems to have reached the latest low point. It is expected that the price will rebound before long. In the future, the bidding prices of the domestic projects are being announced. However, there are quite a number of manufacturers insisting on their quoted price. Their power struggle may later become the focus of the market. The overseas market is getting back to normal, where installations are carried out as planned. Some of the products may be affected by the fluctuation of the exchange rates. The overall demand, however, is not likely to be affected. The ripple effect of China’s Golden Week Holiday in October is expanding as expected. The market is slowly back on track.
Polysilicon
The market of the polysilicon is mixed this week. The pressure of price reduction of mono polysilicon comes from the downstream manufacturers that are unwilling to decrease their own prices. The price increase of multi polysilicon is due to short supply, which increases the demand. The downstream manufacturers are unable to withstand the cost of mono polysilicon, therefore switched to produce the multi-Si products to relieve the pressure to produce.
The overseas price is yet to be adjusted. However, the downward-sliding exchange rates are also bringing it down. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.74~9.74USD/KG. The average price is lowered to 9.06USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 8.91USD/KG.
In the domestic markets, the range of polysilicon price revision is 58~61RMB/KG. The average price is revised upward to 60RMB/KG. The range of the mono polysilicon price revision is 73~76RMB/KG. The average price is revised downward to 75RMB/KG.
Silicon wafer
The price of the wafer is beginning to shift this week. The multi-Si wafers have slightly revised the price upward. The demand is increased due to the downstream cell manufacturers switching to produce multi-Si cells. There is no significant change in the mono-Si wafer market. It is getting harder and harder for the smaller manufacturers to maintain their price. There has already been a few quoted prices that are below the market price. In the overseas market, the price of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.403USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.440USD/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above remains unchanged at 0.450USD/Pc. The range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is 0.226~0.230USD/Pc.

The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 2.06RMB/Pc.
Cell
The cell market price is rising this week. The inventory level of the top-tier manufacturers has come to a relatively low level. The insistence on the reserve price is still quite robust. The small and medium manufacturers do not have such liberty. The pressure to reduce the price is still weighing on their mind at the negotiation table. In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is 0.102~0.123USD/W at the moment. The average price is lowered to 0.107USD/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.105~0.115USD/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.131~0.150USD/W.

Module
The price of the module market is also shifting as the prices of their upstream counterparts vary. It is mainly under the influence of the announced auction price of the domestic projects. The overseas markets were also affected due to the fluctuation of the exchange rates and the slow-selling multi-Si products. In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si (270-275W) remains unchanged at 0.205~0.248USD/W at the moment. The average price is lowered to 0.212USD/W.

This week overall market continues the upward trajectory from last week. A lot more trading is taking place. In the upstream market, multi polysilicon is bouncing back, while the mono polysilicon maintains its stability. Regarding the wafers, the market expects positive change, which has yet to be reflected in the closing price. Cells are also facing a similar situation. There is not much change in the module market, being the slowest to adjust. Looking ahead, the power struggle between the upstream and downstream manufacturers are rapidly intensifying. It is estimated that part of the purchase agreements from Q4 will be negotiated and signed by the end of the month. The overseas market has also joined the club of rising demand. Given that the global demand is also activated in Q4, it depends on the changes in the market price to determine whether or not the abundant supply chain can fully cover the demand.
Polysilicon
The price of the multi polysilicon has begun to shift. As for the mono polysilicon, because most of the purchase contracts in this month have been signed, last-minute orders have limited impact on the market price. The rising price of the multi polysilicon is the product of an increasing demand and inadequate supply, which continued from last week. Most of the manufacturers which are under regular maintenance of capacity are returning to operate at full capacity. Therefore the shortage in supply in this month is inevitable. There is no significant change in the overseas prices. The exchange rate is also stabilizing.
The range of the price revision remains unchanged at 8.74~9.74USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.05USD/KG. The global average price has risen to 8.94USD/KG.
In the domestic market, the range of polysilicon price revision is 59~63RMB/KG. The average price is raised to 61RMB/KG. The price range of the mono polysilicon remains unchanged at 73~76RMB/KG.
Wafers
An incremental change is taking place in the price of wafers. The price of the multi-Si wafers has once again shifted, narrowing the price range. The average price is quite stable by all appearances. Mono-Si wafer manufacturers are struggling to increase the prices with little success. However, a small number of small and medium-sized manufacturers have followed the footsteps of multi-Si wafers and slightly increased the price.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.395~0.421USD/Pc at the moment. The average price is 0.408USD/Pc. The price of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.445~0.455USD/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above remains unchanged at 0.460USD/Pc.

In the domestic market, the price range of the mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 3.02~3.15RMB/Pc. The average price is 3.08RMB/Pc. The price range of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 3.30~3.40RMB/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers with the size of 161.75mm remains unchanged at 3.45RMB/ Pc. The range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is 1.82~1.85RMB/Pc. The average price remains unchanged at 1.83RMB/Pc. The price of the black silicon product remains unchanged at 2.06RMB/Pc.
Cell
The signals of a rising cell price in the market are getting brighter and brighter this week, although the price has not changed much. The pressure to increase the price is mounting in the market. The mono-Si cells are not the only ones screaming for a rise in the price. The multi PERC cells are also itching to creep upward. Even some manufacturers have already revised its price by 0.01~0.02 RMB. The market is showing all kinds of signs that the bargaining power between the upstream and downstream players determines the closing price. 
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at 0.102~0.123USD/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.105~0.115USD/W.

The price of the bifacial high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.96RMB/W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) is revised down to 1.01RMB/W.
Module
The module market is still stable with a slightly weak demand, although the upstream market is bustling. Due to a shorter production cycle, modules are not affected by the changes in the upstream market. The immediate demand is still what drives the module market.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si (270-275W) remains unchanged at 0.205~0.248USD/W at the moment. The average price is lowered to 0.210USD/W.

There are more and more signs signaling a price increase in the overall market this week. An increasingly bullish market sentiment is taking hold of the entire supply chain. The price of the upstream polysilicon is increased due to the changes of the downstream wafer. The cell price is also on the rise on account of more signed purchase agreements. Modules, on the other hand, are witnessing irrational sell-off from some smaller manufacturers, who can no longer withstand the pressure to sell.
In the future, as the domestic residential projects and subsidized auction projects are being developed or connected to the grid, the products, mono-Si or not, are all thriving in their own markets. Overseas demand is still under steady development. It is estimated that the overseas demand will be so strong, that it will compete for the supply of goods with the Chinese market.
Polysilicon
The multi polysilicon price continued the upward trajectory from last week. The mono polysilicon price is also rising. The price increase of multi polysilicon is the result of a continuously rising demand and an inadequate supply. The overseas price is slightly increased on account of the exchange rate fluctuations. With the upcoming peak season in Q4, the most upstream polysilicon may not fully reflect the bullish market. However, the overall polysilicon market will at least perform better than Q3.
In the overseas market, the range of the price increase is 8.76~9.76USD/KG at the moment. The average price is revised up to 9.07USD/KG. The global average price is revised up to 9.05USD/KG.
In the domestic market, the range of polysilicon price revision is 61~63RMB/KG at the moment. The average price is revised up to 62RMB/KG. The range of the mono polysilicon price revision is 73~78RMB/KG. The average price is raised to 76RMB/KG.
Silicon Wafers
This week, the price of wafers has risen sharply. Multi-Si wafers have been affected by the upstream supply shortages. Therefore the price has been adjusted again. The mono-Si wafers have been affected by overseas exchange rates as well as new price quotation methods since last week, which are offered according to different sizes. In fact, the market is expected to continue its bullish trend.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.395~0.421USD/Pc at the moment. The average price is revised to 0.403USD/Pc.

The price range of the multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at 1.82~1.86RMB/Pc. The average price is raised to 1.85RMB/Pc. The price of the black silicon product remains unchanged at 2.06RMB/Pc.
Cells
The cell price is also on the rise this week, on account of more signed purchase agreements. Although the mono-Si cell price performance is better, multi-Si cell still accounts for 30~40% of the capacity, according to China's recent auctions.  An increase in the multi-Si cell price is only a matter of time.

Module
This week, the overseas market of modules is still stable. The domestic market, some smaller manufacturers are selling their high-efficiency products under an unreasonable price. The focus of the market is whether or not Q4 would be a peak season as it always had been. The performance of the Chinese market will be under the spotlight.

As the end of the month and the long holiday are fast approaching, the overall market expects that the construction can be accelerated after the holiday. The upstream market is optimistic about the price going up. In the overseas market, the price is already rising. Although there is not much change on the wafer front, it is estimated that the demand would be quite strong. The overall price of the cells was also revised slightly. The module is still waiting for the change that might come after the holidays. Looking ahead, the residential projects in China need to be connected to the grid by the end of October. The subsidized auction projects will continue to produce good news. It is estimated that in the fourth quarter, the focus of global supply and demand will be concentrated in the Chinese market.
Polysilicon
The price of multi polysilicon is still rising this week. Although there is little change in the price of mono polysilicon, the demand from the downstream market may drive up the price. It is estimated that changes may take place next month. The multi polysilicon is affected by the increased capacity of the mono polysilicon, which, in turn, reduced the existing capacity of the multi polysilicon. Therefore the price has been increasing noticeably. The overseas prices have been affected by the domestic market sentiment. The two overseas polysilicon suppliers have both followed suit and raised the prices. In the overseas market, the range of the price increase is 9.01~9.89USD/KG at the moment. The average price is raised to 9.24USD/KG. The global average price is raised to 9.12USD/KG. In the domestic market, the range of polysilicon price revision is 61~64RMB/KG at the moment. The average price is raised to 63RMB/KG. The price range of the mono polysilicon remains unchanged at 73~78RMB/KG.
Silicon Wafers
This week, the price of wafers continued the upward trend from last week. The price of the multi-Si wafers in overseas markets has been adjusted again, because their capacity has been diminished. The mono-Si wafers trended flat. The two leading manufacturers also stuck to their strategy, which does not involve adjusting prices this month. It is estimated that this move is intended to stabilize the incessant demands from the downstream. Recently, a sales approach, which involves the purchase of multi-Si wafers being coupled with a purchase of its mono-Si counterparts, is emerging. Such an approach has been adopted before. However, it was the other way round before. It is estimated that this move is intended to balance out the excessive inventory of the mono-Si wafers, which is expected by the market.  In the overseas market, the price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.395~0.421USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.445~0.455USD/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above remains unchanged at 0.460USD/Pc. The price range of the multi-Si wafer has been revised upward to 0.234~0.238USD/Pc. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 0.260USD/Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafers is 0.339~0.343USD/W. In the domestic market, the price range of the mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 3.02~3.15RMB/Pc.

Cells
This week, the market price of the cells is also adjusted, following the upstream market. With the arrival of the long holiday, the market does not reflect any rush of stocking, which, by estimation, has to do with the post-holiday demand that the marketing is counting on. In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at 0.102~0.123USD/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.105~0.115USD/W.

The price trend of the overall market is still unclear this week, which is related to the average contract price of the upstream wafers by estimation. The upstream polysilicon and wafers will maintain its slow upward trajectory. The average contract price at the end of this month will affect the price trend of the overall market next month. The prices of the cells and modules are decreasing because the market has an excess supply of high-priced products. In the fourth quarter, the fixed average contract price of wafers at the end of the month will affect the changes in the overall supply chain. Although there is a demand for the products in the overseas market, it is also necessary to benchmark the price against the domestic trend of the average contract price. It is estimated that a robust demand is emerging in China, which can continue its momentum until the Chinese New Year next year.
Polysilicon
This week, the price of polysilicon maintains its steady upward trajectory. Both of the prices in the domestic and overseas markets remain stable. All the manufacturers are operating at the full capacity, which seems to show no sign of being affected by the reduced production.

Silicon Wafers
The price of wafers remains stable this week. The demand for mono-Si wafers remains strong. However, there is no sign of price increases, which is mainly related to the gradual increase in supply. The production of the multi-Si wafers is reduced, in response to the excess demand for high demand. The price is therefore increased.

The overall market price this week was not as expected. Rather, it showed signs of reversal. Contrary to the original estimation, the de-inventory speed of the mono-Si products was not improving.

The price of the multi-Si products also decreased due to the increase in the previous capacity conversion. Both the upstream polysilicon and wafers hope that the end-of-month average contract price would enliven the market. However, the manufacturers do not seem to have much confidence in the market. Regarding the downstream cells and modules, the major players are still stable, while the smaller ones are waiting for purchase orders. In the future, the fixed average contract price of wafers at the end of the month will become the center of attention. First, it will affect the resource deployment of the cell manufacturers that are purchasing wafers next month. Secondly, the chain effect which will be set in motion by the wafers will be reflected in the market price changes of the downstream cells and modules.
Polysilicon
The price of the polysilicon shows a flattened trend this week. The orders delivered are mainly received in October. It is estimated that there will be a bigger change when the price is updated in the new purchase orders next week. The market of the mono-grade polysilicon is mostly stable. The polysilicon, on the other hand, is in slightly short supply, owing to the fact that its demand and supply are not seamlessly connected.
In the overseas market, the price remains unchanged at 9.01~9.88USD/KG. The global average price remains unchanged at 9.12USD/KG. In the domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 75~78RMB/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 76USD/KG. The polysilicon remains unchanged at 61~64RMB/KG.
Wafers
This week, the price of wafers remains stable. A wait-and-watch sentiment is taking hold of the mono-Si market because the end-of-month average contract price will be out next week. However, the market is not optimistic about the subsequent development. By estimation, it is related to the circulation of goods in the market. With the timely conversion of downstream capacity, the multi-Si wafers have reversed the position of its supply and demand in the market for a while, which led to the crumbling of its price.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.395~0.421USD/Pc at the moment.

Modules
This week, the module price in the market is on a similar trajectory as last week. The price of the high-watt products continues to fall, while the products with lower price remain stable. The manufacturers that are active in the market are mainly the top-tier ones with a steady flow of purchase orders. It is getting harder and harder for the small and medium-sized manufacturers to remain afloat.

This week, the overall market confidence hit the rock bottom. Not only did China's announcement of installed capacity fall short of expectations but the overall market is not more optimistic about the price after the end-of-month average contract price of the wafers was announced. 
Image by Jukka Niittymaa from Pixabay
The development of the upstream polysilicon and wafers did not live up to the market expectation. The price announcement did not motivate the downstream manufacturers of cells and modules to intensify their restocking, which indirectly triggers the sense of helplessness among them. Irrational price reductions and dumping are emerging in the overall market. In the upcoming two months, the underperforming installed PV capacity has shaken the market confidence, which leads to the whole industry giving up on achieving the goal of 2019. It is getting more obvious that the businesses are pinning their hopes on the first half of 2020H1. 
Polysilicon
 The price of polysilicon shows a flattened trend this week. It seems unlikely that the expected huge increase in demand would take place. In order to stabilize the upcoming orders, the sellers manage to keep the price unchanged, even if this means the capacity needs to be slightly lower than last month. Only the prices in overseas markets are indirectly changed due to the exchange rate fluctuations.
In the overseas market, the price is revised up to 9.03~9.91USD/KG. The average price is raised to 9.30USD/KG. The global average price is raised to 9.15USD/KG.
In the domestic market, the mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at 75~78RMB/KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 62~64RMB/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 63RMB/KG.
Wafers
 This week, the price of wafers still did not pick up after the major players announced their average contract price for the next month. The prices of mono-Si wafers vary depending on the product categories. Some new small factories were joining the market, which seemed to increase the bargaining power of the buyers. Therefore the range of the prices offered continued to widen. The multi-Si products are on a fast downward spiral after continuing the price reversal of PV cells from last week. Much capacity, which was switched to multi-Si productions, was switched back to mono-Si production. The room for bargaining is expanding due to the growing inventory level.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafers is revised down to 0.228~0.232USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 0.260USD/Pc. The range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafer price revision is 0.385~0.421USD/Pc. The average price remains unchanged at 0.405USD/Pc.

The price range of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 3.30~3.37RMB/Pc. The price range of the 166.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 3.47RMB/Pc.
Cells
 The cells see disarray in their market price and capacity this week. The production lines, which were producing multi-Si products, were switched back to Mono-Si products or simply stopped. The method of pricing was also changed. The cells are now sold cell by cell, which led the overall market to be pessimistic about multi-Si products. Mono-Si cell prices remained stable, except in the overseas market, where more and more manufacturers resorted to price competition due to the arrival of new capacity.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.098~0.123USD/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.102~0.113USD/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell is revised down to 0.115~0.145USD/W. The average price is lowered to 0.120USD/W.

The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) remains unchanged at 1.01RMB/W.
Modules
 The market price trend of the modules still varies, depending on the regional demand. It is even more difficult for the small and medium manufacturers to get purchase orders, followed by the pressure of the rising inventory level. The expected boom is delayed yet again. Therefore the market is likely to remain pessimistic until the end of the year.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si (270-275W) remains unchanged at 0.205~0.248USD/W at the moment. The average price is lowered to 0.208USD/W.

A gloomy mood has taken hold of the overall market this week. There is little reason to hope for the peak season that may never come this year. Other than the price of polysilicon, which is relatively stable, the price of the rest of the supply chain is looking at a downward trend.

In the near future, the market is likely to remain bearish. If the domestic installed capacity could, by any chance, rise to the targeted 30GW, the manufacturers of the PV supply chain would have reasons to be hopeful and look forward to 2020H1.
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon is still one of the relatively stable links of the PV supply chain this week. The mono-grade polysilicon is supported by the stable capacity and supply of downstream links. Therefore the price remains stable. The price of polysilicon drops slightly from time to time, on account of the instability of its own supply and the decline in the demand of the downstream buyers. It is estimated that the price fluctuations similar to that this week will continue until the end of this year. While overseas prices are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, there is no actual adjustment.
In the overseas market, the price range is revised up to 9.09~9.98USD/KG. The average price is raised to 9.35USD/KG. The global average price is raised to 9.16USD/KG.
In the domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 73~78RMB/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 76RMB/KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 60~63RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 61RMB/KG.
Wafers
This week, the price of wafers demonstrates a polarized development, due to the price fluctuations from the downstream links and the different market strategies adopted by the industry leaders and the smaller manufacturers. Although the end-of-month average contract price of the industry leaders was established last week, the smaller manufacturers that are new to the industry lowered their prices to boost their sales. Consequently, the overall market price is driven downwards. However, the industry leaders have the monopoly over the large size products, of which the price is not affected by the said trend.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafers is revised down to 0.227~0.230USD/Pc at the moment. The average price has been lowered to 0.228USD/Pc.

Cells
This week, the market price of the cells is in a free fall. Due to the gloomy market sentiment, many manufacturers are selling-off their products in an attempt to convert the inventories into cash, which leads to chaos in the market. The manufacturers of multi-Si products do not have any more room for price reduction except the industry leaders. The free fall of the multi-Si product prices is likely to affect the price of the mono-Si products to a certain extent in a later period.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is 0.086~0.120USD/W at the moment. The average price is lowered to 0.093USD/W.

The bleak outlook of the domestic market has set off a bearish chain reaction in the overseas market this week. Despite the fact that the domestic projects are being implemented, the market is not thriving as expected. The small and medium-sized module manufacturers have lost hope in the domestic market this year. Consequently, they turned their attention to the overseas market. Due to the vicious price competition, the overseas market price this week is downward spiraling into chaos.

This week, each link in the PV supply chain shows diverse development. The upstream polysilicon and wafers are affected by the slowdown in the demand from the downstream, which causes the price to be on a downward trend. Regarding the cells and modules, the different types of products and the demand of different regions show different progress, resulting in a mixed development in the markets of these two products. In the upcoming month, if there is some kind of surge in the domestic demand, coupled with a stable volume of exports, this could still inspire some confidence for the next year.
Polysilicon
Due to the weak demand from the downstream, the price of the polysilicon is generally on the decline this week. Although the demand for mono-grade polysilicon was weak, the overall market was still relatively stable. However, the market of the polysilicon did not inspire much optimism. In addition to an unstable demand, the intermittent supply of its capacity indirectly affects the balance between supply and demand. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 9.10~9.86USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.34USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 9.13USD/KG. In the domestic market, the price range of the mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at 73~78RMB/KG, The range of the polysilicon price revision is 58~62RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 60RMB/KG.
Wafers
The price of wafers demonstrated the same development as the polysilicon. Compared to multi-Si wafers, the supply and demand of mono-Si wafers are relatively stable. Therefore the price is steady. The prices of the smaller manufacturers may be adjusted due to the inventory pressure in certain occasions, which, however, does not rattle the overall market much. Multi-Si wafers show similar trend as the polysilicon, where both the supply and demand are unstable. What makes the matters worse for the multi-wafers are the unstable demand as well as the low utilization rate of the overall multi-Si wafer capacity (under 40%).
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafers is revised down to 0.225~0.228USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 0.260USD/Pc.The price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at 0.380~0.423USD/Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75mm) remains unchanged at 0.430~0.455USD/Pc. The price of the wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above remains unchanged at 0.460USD/Pc.

The price range of the cast-mono wafers remains unchanged at 2.67~2.70RMB/Pc. The price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 2.98~3.15RMB/Pc. The price range of the large size wafers (158.75mm) remains unchanged at 3.30~3.37RMB/Pc. The price of the 166.75mm wafers remains unchanged at 3.47RMB/Pc.
Cells
The market price of the PV cells is mixed. The offered prices of the multi-Si cells are in chaos, because the domestic demand is unstable and the smaller manufacturers are selling off the inventory. The mono-Si cells depend on the urgent restocking orders of small quantity, which helps stabilize the price with signs of rising. The multi-Si cells in overseas markets are supported by the demand from India and some European markets. Therefore the price is not as volatile as that in the domestic market. However, there is no guarantee that the said stability would be sustainable. The overseas demand for mono-Si is similar to that of the domestic market. The price fluctuations are merely the ups and downs of individual regions.

Modules
The overseas and domestic market prices of the modules show mixed development this week. In most markets, the price maintained stable, except for Vietnam’s export prices to the US. Due to the weak demand in the domestic market, the pressure to decrease is slowly creeping into the downstream of the supply chain. Only the more economically-priced modules, which are pretty much bottomed out, managed to maintain their stability, while the rest of the products has been revised down to a certain degree.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si (270-275W) remains unchanged at 0.202~0.240USD/W.

The inventory level of certain products continued to rise. Some of the manufacturers resorted to sell-off. In every link of the overall supply chain, the price of the multi-Si products continued to plunge, while a wait-and-see sentiment was taking hold of the mono-Si markets. The industry insiders had little reason to look forward to the new business in the upcoming month. Looking ahead, due to lack of the support from China’s government policies, businesses relied heavily on exports for their revenue. They might not be optimistically waiting for the market to boom anymore.
 
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon continued to be affected by the sluggish demand from the downstream this week. The mono-grade polysilicon was affected by a decrease or halt in production, resulting in an increase in the inventory level. The price of polysilicon managed to hold firm, about which the market nonetheless was not optimistic. 
In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 9.09~9.72USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.30USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 9.05USD/KG. 
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 72~77RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 75RMB/KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 58~61RMB/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 60RMB/KG.
 
Wafers
The wafer market indicated a mixed performance this week. The mono-Si wafers were supported by the demand for small quantities of their products. Although the inventory level was slightly increased, the price could remain stable. Multi-Si wafers were still suffering from weak demand and slow to digest the inventory. Some small manufacturers have decreased or even stopped their production, which had impact on the market price.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is 0.225~0.227USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products is lowered to 0.256USD/Pc. The price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.380~0.423USD/Pc. The price range of the large size wafers (158.75mm) remains unchanged at 0.430~0.455USD/Pc. The price of the wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above remains unchanged at 0.460USD/Pc.

Cells
As the market preference has shifted to mono-Si products, the price for multi-Si products continued its decline this week. Many smaller manufacturers were forced to trade at a price lower than the cash cost. Therefore some manufacturers have chosen to reduce production or switch back to produce mono-Si products. The inventory level of multi-Si major manufacturers remained high, which was estimated to affect the price in the following two to three weeks. The prices of the mono-Si products showed a flattened trend due to a stable demand and supply. However, industry insiders were not optimistic about the price in the following month.

This week, the overall market sentiment was the same as last week. The inventory level of the upstream polysilicon has gradually increased, which put the manufacturers under pressure to reduce prices. There was no change in wafers’ routine end-of-month average contract price. 
Image by seagul from Pixabay
However, the downstream links were still reluctant to restock. Although the price drop of PV cells and modules was slightly stabilized, it was still difficult to improve the existing market sentiment without seeing future demand. In the upcoming month, there is less likelihood of much hype by the end of this year. The industry insiders can only hope that the trend in the first quarter of next year would be similar to this year, which is good enough news for the overall industry.
Polysilicon
This week was the last week of the month, where most of the polysilicon purchase contracts for next month were being signed and the new prices negotiated. Regardless of the product category or regional markets, the prices were more or less revised downward. In addition to the fact that the market demand was weaker than expected, the rise of the overall inventory level was also one of the factors affecting the price trend. In comparison with mono-grade polysilicon, the price of polysilicon was dropping at an alarming rate. There is, by estimation, little reason to be optimistic until the end of this year.
In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.81 ~ 9.43USD / KG. The average price is lowered to 9.06USD / KG. The global average price is lowered to 8.78USD / KG. In the domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 71 ~ 76RMB / KG. The average price is lowered to 73RMB / KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 55 ~ 60RMB / KG. The average price is lowered to 58RMB / KG.
Wafers
The price trend of wafers this week was the same as that of last week. The price of mono-Si wafers managed to stay stable. Regarding the multi-Si wafers, the speed of inventory digestion was still slow, the market demand weak. As a result, the inventory level of multi-Si wafers has shown limited improvement, which could not inspire the smaller manufacturers to stop the price competition. Although the utilization rate has been reduced below 50%, the prices have yet to be stabilized.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is 0.218 ~ 0.220USD / Pc. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 0.256USD / Pc. The price range of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.380 ~ 0.423USD / Pc. The price range of the large size wafers (158.75mm) remains unchanged at 0.430 ~ 0.455USD / Pc.

PV Cells
This week, the price plunge of PV cells seemed to have come to an end. Actually, there was little improvement in the market. The inventory level of multi-Si products continued to rise. Despite the fact that the small and medium-sized manufacturers have shut down the production for more than a month, the multi-Si products were still slow to sell. Manufacturers with both mono- and multi-Si production lines tried to reduce inventory levels by bundle selling their mono- and multi-Si products together with limited success. Some top-tier manufacturers who were low on cash also suspended their production. The industry insiders were no longer looking forward to December, which is supposed to be the peak season. They are hoping that the business might pick up in 2020.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is 0.082 ~ 0.110USD / W. The average price remains unchanged at 0.086USD / W.

Modules
The module market price was still stable this week. The prices of individual products were adjusted according to the offered prices in different regions and the actual market demand. Given that the market demand was still weak, it is estimated that the future price trend will be less than optimistic.

The overall market sentiment this week was same as last week. The inventory level of the polysilicon from the upstream has gradually increased, which put manufacturers under pressure to reduce prices. The mono- and multi-Si wafers demonstrated a polarized development.

Regarding the cells and modules from downstream, their Chinese domestic and overseas markets also showed a polarized development. In the future, if the prices of mono-Si products could be sustained with enough demand, it may be possible to mitigate the sluggishness of the overall supply chain. The prices of the multi-Si products depend on the dynamics of the supply and demand. It would be advisable if the excess supply could be reduced and demand increased.
Polysilicon
This week, the polysilicon prices of the Chinese domestic market continued to drop. In addition to the market demand that was weaker than expected, the high inventory level was also one of the sources of pressure felt by the manufacturers. The prices of the multi-Si products, in particular, were quoted below the cash costs. If the current difficulties are to be solved, they must adjust their own product mix and supply model, otherwise they should stop the production. 
In the overseas market, the price range remained unchanged at 8.81 ~ 9.43USD / KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.02USD / KG. The global average price is lowered to 8.62USD / KG. In the domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 70 ~ 76RMB / KG. The average price is lowered to 72RMB / KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 53 ~ 56RMB / KG. The average price is lowered to 55RMB / KG.
Wafers
The price trend of wafers has not changed much this week. The price of mono-Si wafers remained stable. There are even some urgent orders that made the supply tight. The price of multi-Si wafers continued to decline. Despite the fact that half of the multi-Si manufacturers have stopped the production, the free fall of the prices continued.

PV Cells
Regarding the prices of the cells, their Chinese domestic and overseas markets showed different developments this week. In the overseas market, some of multi-Si cell channels were switched to serve the mono-Si cells, which made the multi-Si products rare commodities. As a result, their prices showed a mixed development. In the overseas market for mono-Si products, the supply for shipments were growing tight. Other than the top-tier manufacturers delivering the existing orders, the demand for multi-Si products being partially replaced by the mono-Si products has affected the overall supply. In fact, the overall demand for mono- and multi-Si has not increased. Rather, there were simply changes in the product mix. In China, there were some slight price revisions only in high-efficiency cells. The rest has not changed much.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is 0.084 ~ 0.118USD / W at the moment. The average price is raised to 0.093USD / W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.102 ~ 0.107USD / W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.112 ~ 0.133USD / W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) remains unchanged at 0.115 ~ 0.168USD / W.

The prices of PV cells and modules also followed the same trajectory as the multi-Si wafers. The overall market has demonstrated the following trend: the prices of the mono-Si products maintained their stability, while the prices of the multi-Si products were declining. In the future, the prices of the mono-Si products will continue to be supported by demand with a high likelihood to bounce back. Multi-Si product manufacturers will have to survive on whatever they could get. The bottom line for them is to avoid losses. 
Polysilicon
This week, the Chinese domestic prices of polysilicon continued their decline. The polysilicon manufacturers were pressured by the multi-Si wafer manufacturers to lower the price. Most polysilicon manufacturers could not afford to sell their products at the price lower than their cash cost, which led to them reducing or suspending production. As for the mono-grade polysilicon manufacturers, they were still under pressure to lower their prices, although the pressure was not as obvious. Consequently, the manufacturers were forced to adjust their prices. Not only the Chinese domestic market but also the overseas market have shown prices being revised down. This was mainly due to the price pressure in the Chinese domestic market.
 In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 69 ~ 75 RMB/KG at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at 72 RMB/KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 53 ~ 55 RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 54 RMB/KG. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.55 ~ 9.18 USD/KG. The average price is lowered to 8.80 USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 8.54 USD/KG. 
Wafers
This week, the prices of wafers still showed the same development: the mono-Si price stayed stable, while the multi-Si kept on falling. There were instances where the supply of mono-Si wafers were tight, but it was only the case for the smaller and medium manufacturers. Therefore the price did not rise, even if there was a shortage. It is estimated that there might be some disruption in the market prices next week. The price of multi-Si wafers will continue to fall. Some manufacturers expect that the duration of production suspension would continue until the end of this year. This pessimistic sentiment is taking hold of the market.

Cells
The market price of the PV cells demonstrated an almost identical development as the wafers this week. There were some developments in the Chinese domestic market of multi-Si products, which had no impact on other regions or product categories. Compared with the multi-Si wafers, the demand for mono-Si wafers was relatively stronger. The capacity of the top-tier manufacturers was almost maxed out. Therefore the prices were relatively stable. The multi-Si cell market continued to be in a slump. The overall inventory level was on the rise. There was little trading at the current price in the market. 
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is 0.081 ~ 0.118 USD/W at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at 0.093 USD/W.

This week, there was not much change in the overall market since last week. The mono-grade polysilicon has stopped the plunge and shown signs of bouncing back, while the polysilicon was still in a free fall.

Wafers also showed mixed developments: the prices of the mono-Si products maintained their stability, while the prices of the multi-Si products were declining. It was quite obvious that the smaller manufacturers were selling-off when they were doing business overseas. The PV cells and modules also demonstrated mixed developments that were similar to the wafers. The development of the overall downstream links depended on the trend of the wafers. Looking ahead, the fact that the prices of the mono-Si products have bottomed out signals the arrival of the change. The manufacturing capacity and supply of multi-Si products, on the other hand, needs to be reduced, so that the plunge of the price could be stopped, balancing the market demand. 
Polysilicon
The price of silicon materials this week continued the trend of last week. Some of the business for polysilicon was conducted at lower prices, which was estimated to be selling at losses. Without the mono-grade polysilicon driving up the sales in a short period of time, this trend of low prices would continue and be expanded. The price of the mono-grade polysilicon continued to be on a flat trend due to the stable demand and a decrease in the inventory level. If the demand gets higher and more urgent in the future, it cannot be ruled that the price may bottom out and rise again.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the mono-grade polysilicon is 69~75 RMB/KG at the moment. The range of polysilicon price revision is 50~54 RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 52 RMB/KG. In the overseas market, the overseas prices are affected due to the fact that the renminbi depreciated to 7 RMB per dollar. The price revision is revised upwards to 8.60~9.23 USD/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 8.80 USD/KG. The global average price is revised downward to 8.72 USD/KG. 
Wafers
This week, the wafer prices were affected by the changes in the market demand. The overseas prices of mono-Si wafers have begun showing signs of downward revision on account of the B-list manufacturers selling-off at lower prices. Although their overall transaction volume was far less than two major manufacturers, the price trends were affected, to a certain degree. The price of multi-Si wafers continued to drop. The B-list manufacturers were increasingly selling-off their products, which forced the first-tier manufacturers to reduce their prices as well.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is 0.197~0.203 USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products is lowered to 0.250 USD/Pc. The range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer price revision is 0.380~0.421 USD/Pc. The average price is lowered to 0.395 USD/Pc. The price range of the large size wafers (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at 0.425~0.460 USD/Pc. The price of the wafers with the size of 161.75 mm and above remains unchanged at 0.470 USD/Pc.

This week, the overall market still showed mixed developments: the prices of the mono-Si products maintained their stability, while the prices of the multi-Si products were declining, which has spread to the entire supply chain. 
Image by Samuel Faber from Pixabay
The prices of the mono-Si products were supported by the stable supply and demand, which could even result in excess demand. The prices of the multi-Si products, on the other hand, were still in a free fall. The extent of the decline was not that alarming. However, the fact that this decline saw no end in sight was still worrying. Looking ahead, the next surge comes from the restocking before the Chinese New Year. Some major overseas markets were not doing as well as expected. However, the existing capacity for manufacturing could still manage to deliver the current orders and fulfill the expectations of the market. It is to be hoped that the new year could bring a whiff of optimism.
Polysilicon
 The price of the polysilicon still remained the same as last week: the prices of the mono-Si products maintained their stability, while the prices of the multi-Si products were declining this week. The price of the polysilicon continued to be revised down. To reduce inventory, some manufacturers were still willing to accept orders at a lower price. The price of the mono-grade polysilicon showed a flattened trend due to a stable demand and inventory level. 
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the mono-grade polysilicon is 69~75 RMB/KG at the moment. The range of polysilicon price revision is 48~53 RMB/KG. The average price is lowered to 51 RMB/KG. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.59~9.09 USD/KG. The average price is lowered to 8.76 USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 8.48 USD/KG.

Wafers
 The prices of wafers, both mono- and multi-Si, continued their steady trend. Therefore the end-of-month average contract price of mono-Si wafers has not changed very much this month. Some cell manufacturers were stocking up for the orders before the Chinese New Year. The market supply was starting to tighten as the demand rose. The priority of the mono-Si wafers was to keep digesting the inventory. And the prices did not change much as a result.

The Chinese domestic market, on the other hand, is poised to take off after the Chinese New Year.
 
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon this week was quiet as the end of the year approached. The price of mono-grade polysilicon has not changed much. Some smaller manufacturers were still willing to accept orders at a lower price, which, by estimation, would not have much impact on the overall market price. The price of polysilicon, on the other hand, continued its slump. Most of the manufacturers who have not begun their projects planned to halt their production until the CNY is over. Therefore the market sentiment remained low.
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is 67~74 RMB/KG at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at 72 RMB/KG. The range of polysilicon price revision is 48~54 RMB/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 51 RMB/KG. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.64~9.03 USD/KG. The average price remains unchanged at 8.76 USD/KG. The global average price is raised to 8.65 USD/KG.
 
Wafers
This week, the wafer prices still showed mixed developments: the prices of the mono-Si products maintained their stability, while the prices of the multi-Si products were declining. There was a sustainable demand for mono-Si products with ample supply in the market. However, there were only mild changes in prices, which were supported by the major players’ steady stream of incoming orders. The goal of the multi-Si wafers, on the other hand, continued to be inventory reduction. Now only large manufacturers were left to supply the market, which is expected to open the door for some shuffling among the industry players.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer is revised down to 0.191~0.195 USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products is lowered to 0.246 USD/Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at 0.380~0.421 USD/Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at 0.423~0.430 USD/Pc. The price of the 166.75mm wafers remains unchanged at 0.455 USD/Pc.

There were little changes in terms of the trading prices. The price negotiation patterns demonstrated by the buyers and sellers were within the expectation. Looking ahead, in the overseas markets, the construction projects may be started ahead of time. The Mainland Chinese industry insiders have taken a wait-and-see attitude regarding the domestic market after the Chinese New Year.
 
Polysilicon
There was not much change in the price of polysilicon this week. As the CNY is approaching, the proportion of the manufacturers remaining operational was on the low side. Similar to the actions taken by the polysilicon manufacturers last week, most of the manufacturers who have not begun their projects planned to halt their production until the CNY is over. Meanwhile, the number of wafer manufacturers remaining in operation during this time of the year continued to decline, which complemented the picture of a market getting ready for the Chinese New Year. 
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is RMB 68~75 /KG at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at RMB 72 /KG. The range of the polysilicon price revision is RMB 43~54 /KG. The average price remains unchanged at RMB 51 /KG. In the overseas market, the range of the overseas price revision is US$8.66~9.05 /KG. The average price is revised up to US$8.78 /KG. The global average price is revised up to US$8.67 /KG.
 
Wafers
The price of wafers has maintained its stability this week. As the Chinese New Year approaches, manufacturers have been actively restocking to prepare for the volatile market after the CNY, despite the tight supply. The multi-Si wafer manufacturers continued to focus on inventory reduction. There were fewer and fewer manufacturers that still remained in operation. Small and medium-sized manufacturers who were struggling showed clear intentions of selling off their inventories at major discounts, which, conversely, did not affect market trends in terms of the price and quantity.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.191~0.195 /Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.246 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380~0.421 /Pc.

Cells
The cell market was relatively stable this week, which was mainly because the majority of businesses were in preparations for the upcoming holidays. Some manufacturers have already ended their routine production early, getting ready for the CNY. It is expected that the mono-Si wafer market would be bustling again after the holidays. The multi-Si wafer market, on the other hand, would continue to hope for the return of interest from the market. 
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.077~0.115 /W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.102~0.107 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at US$0.112~0.133 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) remains unchanged at US$0.116~0.165 /W.

 Looking ahead, the constructions of auction projects were expected to commence in the overseas market. It is within the expectation that the constructions of new auction projects from 2020H1 as well as the leftover of 2019 projects would be started. Maybe there is an opportunity to show that construction will continue to flourish until the end of the first half of the year. 
 
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon has not changed much this week. Most companies have completed the restocking orders before the holiday. The changes in the prices fluctuated only within a fixed range, which has not affected the average price.
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the mono-grade polysilicon price revision is RMB 67~74 /KG at the moment. The range of the polysilicon price revision is RMB 48~54 /KG. In the overseas market, the range of the overseas price is raised to US$8.74~9.13 /KG. The average price is revised up to US$8.85 /KG. The global average price is revised up to US$8.75 /KG.
 
Wafers
The prices of the wafers still showed the same development as last week: the multi-Si product prices were slightly revised while the mono-Si products remained stable. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, it would not impact the market price much whether the production line was shut down or not. Although it was difficult for the prices of multi-Si wafers to maintain stability, the decline in the spot prices has shown signs of narrowing. The actual trading prices have decreased relatively little.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is US$0.188~0.195 /Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.246 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380~0.421 /Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at US$0.423~0.430 /Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafers remains unchanged at US$0.455 /Pc.

                                Price Trend: Market Under Pressure of Outbreak. Prices Fluctuate as the Supply Chain Recovers (Or Not)                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200206-16306.html,"

 

As the outbreak expanded and the prolonged holidays took effect this week, the overall market showed various signs of temporary uncertainty in the period after the Spring Festival. The whole supply chain was affected by the above factors. 
The manufacturers that suspended their operation prior to the CNY remain suspended, while those that remained operational continue their production steadily. What follows the new development of the outbreak is an increase in the uncertain risk factors. The market does not show any clear sign when supply and demand would be stable again. Looking ahead, the prices in the overseas market are bound to stop the free fall and bounce back, on account of the shortage of raw materials exported from China. As for the Chinese domestic market, the overall market is affected by the delays. It is estimated that the damage of individual links of the supply chain would not be overly prominent. The focus of everyone’s concern is when the market can be rid of the impact of this outbreak. 
 
Polysilicon
Due to the outbreak, the price of polysilicon this week was still under the sway of the holidays. Even during the Spring Festival, most polysilicon companies did not completely suspend production. Therefore, the overall supply was still stable. However, it cannot be ruled out that the majority of polysilicon manufacturers might increase their offered prices due to the following factors: the increased uncertainty of the supply of silica, polysilicon's upstream raw material, how well the transport has recovered, how smooth the connection of logistics services can be after the Lunar New Year.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon is RMB 67~74 /KG at the moment. The price range of the polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 48 ~ 54 / KG. Affected by exchange rate fluctuations, the range of the overseas price is lowered to US$8.62 ~ 9.00 / KG. The average price is lowered to US$8.77 / KG. The global average price is lowered to US$8.64 / KG.
 
Wafers
There have been no new transactions in wafer prices this week. Consequently, there was no change in prices. Due to the compounded effects of the outbreak and the holidays, the lead time of the supply chain has been extended for one to two weeks. The production of mono-Si wafers has been uninterrupted up until now, which minimized the impact of the outbreak on the supply. The PV cell manufacturers, on the other hand, believed that logistics and transportation might affect the delivery dates after CNY. This led to their restocking in advance, which indirectly caused a boom in the segment. Regarding the multi-Si wafers, it is highly likely that the demand will exceed the supply. The reasons contributing to the excess demand are as follows: the date of production resumption is yet to be determined and the logistics services have yet to return to stability.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.188 ~ 0.195 / Pc. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.246 / Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380 ~ 0.421 / Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at US$0.423 ~ 0.430 / Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafers remains unchanged at US$0.455 / Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the 156.75 mm multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 1.52 ~ 1.56 / Pc.  The price of black silicon products remains unchanged at RMB 1.94 / Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.60 ~ 2.65 / Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.95 ~ 3.13 / Pc. The price range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at RMB 3.28 ~ 3.37 / Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.40 /Pc.
 
Cells
This week, the cell manufacturers that suspended their operation prior to the CNY remained suspended, while those that remained operational were waiting for the transportation to ship out the products. This whole link of the supply chain was in a state of idleness. Additionally, the supply of the main raw materials required for the current cell production line faced disruption or the risks of disruption. Wafers, screens, and paste, in particular, are affected by the epidemic. Their overall transportation mechanism in China was put in jeopardy as a result. The said materials were seen as non-emergency materials. Given that they were given lower priority, they were to be dealt with at a slower pace. This has also affected the overall smoothness of productions. It is estimated that this wave of delayed transportation will be reflected in market prices in the future.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.077~0.115 /W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.102~0.107 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at US$0.112~0.133 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) remains unchanged at US$0.116~0.164 /W. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.124 /W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is RMB 0.56 ~ 0.58 / W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cells remains unchanged at RMB 0.61 / W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at RMB 0.80~0.85 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.89~0.95 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.5%) remains unchanged at RMB 0.90 ~ 0.98 / W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (21.5%) remains unchanged at RMB 1.03 / W.
 
Modules
The module market was affected by the epidemic this week. The transportation between provinces and cities in China was severely blocked. The delays and restrictions were also imposed on the resumption dates of the companies. Regarding the overseas market, the complementary materials were less likely to be shipped overseas. It is estimated that the overseas prices of modules would be affected first. Regarding the Chinese domestic market, the impact of the epidemic on the module shipments was not as obvious as it was overseas, given that the entire market was under the influence of the epidemic. As a result of the epidemic spreading its effect from the upstream to the downstream, the product delivery could be delayed, the construction postponed accordingly. The changes in overall prices depend on how well the companies recover after they resume their operation next week.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at US$0.195~0.225 /W at the moment. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remainS unchanged at US$0.198 ~ 0.220 / W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) remains unchanged at US$0.295 ~ 0.390 / W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) remain unchanged at US$0.231~0.335 /W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) remains unchanged at US$0.228~0.385 /W.
In the domestic market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.51~1.62 /W. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.59~1.63 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.63~1.69 /W.

                                Price Trend: The Pressure to Increase Price Is Mounting With the Overseas Downstream Prices Rising First                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200213-16371.html,"


Given that the outbreak was yet to be contained and the labor unable to return to work on time this week, it was inevitable that the price was going up in this under-supplied market. Both the manufacturers and logistics services in China were still not fully operational. The full impact of this outbreak will only start showing in late February. The parties that are most exposed to the impact at the moment are the overseas module manufacturers locating the furthest away from the outbreak. As the pressure of material exhaustion and order delivery is rising, it is expected that the businesses will rush to secure the raw materials. Looking ahead, the prices in overseas markets are starting to fluctuate. The various products would show mixed developments. The supply and demand of the domestic market would rise and fall as the situation of the outbreak changes. The overall supply would be delayed as a result.
 
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon was still stable this week. The supply of silica, polysilicon's upstream raw material, and related supplementary materials was increasingly uncertain. The connection of logistics services was also still unstable. Meanwhile, major overseas manufacturers also announced that some of the production lines that were being maintained will not return to operation for the time being. As a result, the pressure to increase the prices in both of the markets in China and the rest of the world was building up. It is estimated that the changes will be clearly reflected in the prices in March.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 67 ~ 74 /KG at the moment. The price range of the polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 48 ~ 54 /KG. Affected by exchange rate fluctuations, the range of the overseas price is raised to US$8.63 ~ 9.01 /KG. The average price is raised to US$8.78 /KG. The global average price is raised to US$8.65 /KG.
 
Wafers
The wafer prices remained unchanged this week. The markets showed that companies were in the middle of getting their employees to return to work. Prices were quoted more often than they were accepted. On the other hand, there were quite a few manufacturers that have restocked in advance, especially mono-Si manufacturers. Given the situation described above, the prices are very likely to rise in the future.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is US$0.190 ~ 0.195 /Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.246 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380 ~ 0.421 /Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at US$0.423 ~ 0.430/Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafers remains unchanged at US$0.455 /Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the 156.75 mm multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 1.52 ~ 1.56 /Pc. The price of black silicon products remains unchanged at RMB 1.94 /Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.60 ~ 2.65 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer is revised up to RMB 3.00 ~ 3.13 /Pc. The average price remains unchanged at RMB 3.09 /W. The price range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at RMB 3.28 ~ 3.37 /Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.40 /Pc.
 
PV Cells
This week, an increase in the cell price looked imminent in the markets around the globe. The main reason was the outbreak’s impact on the operating rate and the efficiency of the logistics. The supply of main raw materials required for the currently ongoing cell production may be disrupted in the upcoming 2 to 3 weeks, especially wafers, screens and paste. It is estimated that the changes may be reflected in the market prices next week.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell is revised up to US$0.079 ~ 0.115 /W at the moment. The average price is raised to US$0.080 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.102~0.107 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at US$0.112~0.133 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) is revised up to US$0.120 ~ 0.165 /W. The average price is raised to US$0.130 /W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.56 ~ 0.58 /W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cells remains unchanged at RMB 0.61 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at RMB 0.80~0.85 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.89~0.95 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) remains unchanged at RMB 0.90 ~ 0.98 /W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) remains unchanged at RMB 1.03 /W.
 
Modules
The changes in the module prices were first indicated in the overseas market this week. Regarding the Chinese market, the actual changes in the prices have not been reflected in the market, on account of the operation resumption being delayed and restricted. It is estimated that, with the rise of the cell prices, the module price will also follow suit next week. The key supplementary materials were in shortage for the same reasons mentioned above. Many will likely voice their intentions to raise the price due to the short supply in the next few weeks.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) is revised up to US$0.195 ~ 0.229 /W at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.203 /W. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at US$0.198 ~ 0.220 / W. The average price is raised to US$0.218 /W. The range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) price revision is US$0.298 ~ 0.395 /W. The average price is raised to US$0.313 /W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) price revision is US$0.229 ~ 0.340 /W. The average price is lowered to US$0.284 /W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) is revised up to US$0.228 ~ 0.390 /W. The average price is lowered to US$0.258 /W.
In the domestic market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.51~1.62 /W. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.59~1.63 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.63~1.69 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.71~1.80 /W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.76~1.81 /W.

                                Price Trend: Overseas Demand Remains Persistent While Supply Is Expected to Improve in March                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200220-16437.html,"


This week, more and more people were returning to work. The overall market was still recovering from a prolonged holiday as a result. Manufacturers would soon face the problem of the raw material shortages and labor return speed that was slower than expected. These factors had ripple effects on the price changes at the end of the month. Looking ahead, demand from overseas markets remains persistent. Regional markets that traditionally have high demand during this time of the year are driving up the prices. Regarding the domestic market, it still takes some time to return to business as usual. Some parts of the supply chain will soon have difficulties procuring the required raw materials. How they deal with the situation will have an enormous impact on the supply chain.
Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon remained stable this week. The overall supply of the market was still sufficient and stable. The manufacturers that remained operational during the CNY continued their production steadily, while those that suspended their operation were reluctant to resume the business. In addition to the looming shortage of raw materials, the labor return rate and how to adjust the production lines accordingly are also issues to be overcome. The pressure for most manufacturers mainly comes from the rising transportation costs and their ability to deliver the goods on time despite the challenges.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 70~75 /KG at the moment. The price range of the polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 50~54 /KG. Affected by exchange rate fluctuations, the range of the overseas price is lowered to US$8.60 ~ 8.97 /KG. The average price is lowered to US$8.75 /KG. The global average price is lowered to US$8.61 /KG.
Wafers
Silicon wafer prices remained unchanged this week. The pressure of the entire supply chain currently comes from the downstream. In comparison, the pressure on the wafer manufacturers was relatively mild. The supply of mono-Si products remained stable. However, the supply of multi-Si products was lagging behind the demand, mainly due to the fact that there were only a few manufacturers that have resumed their operation.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.190~0.195 /Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.246 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380~0.421 /Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at US$0.423~0.430 /Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafers remains unchanged at US$0.455 /Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the 156.75 mm multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 1.52~1.56 /Pc. The price of black silicon products remains unchanged at RMB 1.94 /Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.60~2.65 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.00~3.13 /Pc. The price range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at RMB 3.28~3.37 /Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.40 /Pc.
PV Cells
The cell market, whether in China or the rest of the world, did not show the price increase as expected this week. Only the supply of multi-Si products lagged behind the demand, which led to price fluctuations. The cell production line that was already in-production had begun to adjust the capacity utilization rate to avoid raw material shortage in the future, which may lead to production difficulties.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.079 ~ 0.115 /W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.102~0.107 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at US$0.112~0.133 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) remains unchanged at US$0.120~0.165 /W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell is revised up to RMB 0.57~0.59 /W. The price of high-efficiency multi-Si cell is raised to RMB 0.62 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.80~0.85 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.89~0.95 /W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) remains unchanged at RMB 0.90~0.98 /W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (21.7%) remains unchanged at RMB 1.03 /W.
Modules
Given that the module market has not yet recovered, the prices in major markets have not changed much this week. Due to China’s slow labor return speed and the delay of logistics and transportation, the supply of key supplementary materials continued to be the focus of the market’s attention. In addition, manufacturers in both China and other major markets have voiced their wishes to increase the module price.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at US$0.195~0.229 /W at the moment. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at US$0.198~0.220 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) remains unchanged at US$0.298~0.395 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) remains unchanged at US$0.229~0.340 /W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) remains unchanged at US$0.228~0.390 /W.

                                Price Trend: Upstream Mono-Si Products Are Heating up While Overseas Module Prices Fluctuate                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200227-16494.html,"


The overall supply and demand in the market were gradually returning to normal this week. Some parts of the supply chain were still under the impact of the shortage in raw materials or the increase in transportation costs. The overall production and operation were basically stable. It is expected that these increased costs would be reflected in subsequent transactions. Judging from the recent developments of COVID-19, the global market continued to be under the impact of the epidemic. However, the extensive supply chain in China can still meet the basic market demand. Given enough time, China’s domestic demand will eventually rebound. Regarding the overseas market demand, the number of PV construction projects should rise or fall, depending on the development of the new coronavirus.
 
Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon began crumbling this week. Coinciding with the time where the end-of-month average contract prices were discussed, there were more and more suppliers voicing their wishes to raise prices. A number of the buyers have accepted the price increase, especially when the deals involved mono-grade polysilicon. The market for polysilicon, however, was not heating up. With regard to the overseas market for polysilicon, 2 major manufacturers have announced their plans to reduce supply. The news has not reflected in the market—at least in the short run. Its ripple effect remains to be seen.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon is revised up to RMB 71~ 75/KG. The average price is revised up to RMB 73/KG. The price range of the polysilicon is revised up to RMB 50~ 55/KG. The average price is revised up to RMB 53/KG. Affected by exchange rate fluctuations, the range of the overseas price is lowered to US$8.58~ 8.96/KG. The average price is lowered to US$8.73 /KG. The global average price is increased to US$8.71 /KG.
 
Wafers
The prices of wafers remained stable this week. There were few changes in the average contract prices which the major manufacturers announced at the end of month. However, there were some slight changes in the developments of the multi- and mono-Si products. The supply of mono-Si products was increased. Therefore there was more room for price negotiation, which led to price differences between larger and smaller manufacturers. Regarding the multi-Si products, the supply was already limited, coupled with a stable demand, the prices continued to show a flattened trend.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.190~0.195 /Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.246 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380~ 0.421/Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) is revised up to US$0.423~ 0.530/Pc. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.430 /Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the 156.75 mm multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 1.52~1.56 /Pc. The price of black silicon products remains unchanged at RMB 1.94 /Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.60~2.65 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.00~3.13 /Pc. The price range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at RMB 3.28~3.37 /Pc. The price of the 166.75 mm wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.40 /Pc.
 
PV Cells
Due to the various developments of different products in terms of the supply and demand, there were slight adjustments in the prices this week. The mono-Si manufacturers continued to provide products to the market without adjusting the volume according to the market demand, which led to supply excess. Multi-Si cells showed similar development as polysilicon and wafers. Both the supply and demand were limited. Therefore the prices managed to stay stable.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is US$0.077~ 0.110/W. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.080 /W. The range of the general mono-Si cell price revision is US$0.101~ 0.107/W. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.105 /W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell price revision is US$0.111~ 0.120/W. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.118 /W. The range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) price revision is US$0.115~ 0.168/W. The average price remained unchanged at US$0.130 /W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell is revised up to RMB 0.57~0.59 /W. The price of high-efficiency multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.62 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.80~0.85 /W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.89~0.95 /W. The range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) price revision is RMB 0.89~ 0.97 /W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (21.7%) is revised down to RMB 0.99 /W.
 
Modules
The recent market developments started to reflect in the crumbling module market prices. With the gradual increase of the labor return rate in China, the market supply has also increased. In the overseas market, the cost of production has increased on account of the shortage in the raw materials of key supplementary materials and increased transportation costs. The prices of the modules which were domestically produced then exported have yet to be reflected in the market.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at US$0.195~0.229 /W at the moment. The average price is raised to US$0.205 /W. The range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) price revision is US$0.198~ 0.223/W. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.218 /W. The range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) price revision is US$0.221~ 0.390 /W. The average price is lowered to US$0.311 /W.

                                Price Trend: Polysilicon Prices Continue to Rise While Overseas Market Demand Continues to Rise Steadily                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200305-16532.html,"


The overall market was still under the impact of the outbreak this week. Despite the shortage in raw materials and rising transportation costs, the overall demand has increased steadily. Looking at the changes in the global market, China’s domestic demandhas not yet returned to normal. For overseas markets, it is inevitable that the initially planned dates of installations and grid connections will be postponed.
 
Polysilicon
This week, the polysilicon prices continued its upward trajectory from last week. The sale prices were almost close to the high point. As the downstream demand gradually stabilized, the trading prices continued to show signs of persistent price increase. Regarding the overseas market, the polysilicon prices also rose this week, due to the impact of the short supply of polysilicon and the fluctuation of exchange rates.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon is revised up to RMB 72~ 75/KG at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at RMB 73 /KG. The price range of the polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 50~ 55/KG. In the overseas market, the price is raised to US$8.78~ 9.29/KG. The average price is raised to US$8.98 /KG. The global average price is raised to US$8.83 /KG. 
 
Wafers
The prices of wafers showed a flattened trend this week. There was a clear gap between the mono-Si wafer prices offered by larger and smaller manufacturers. Due to the huge difference in the volume of sales, the sale prices show limited changes. The supply of multi-Si products remained scarce, while the demand was increasing. It is inevitable that prices would be impacted under such circumstances.

In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer is raised to US$0.194~ 0.197/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products is raised to US$0.248 /Pc. The range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer price revision is US$0.380~ 0.405/Pc. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.395 /Pc.

The price range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at RMB 3.21~3.31 /Pc. The range of the 166.75 mm wafer price revision is RMB 3.35~ 3.47/Pc. The average price remains unchanged at RMB 3.37 /Pc.
 
PV Cells
The market prices of PV cells were affected by the excess supply and the slowdown in demand. Mono-Si products could sense the pressure from the upstream and downstream clearly. Multi-Si products were driven by overseas market demand. Therefore their prices were stabilized. The outbreak has caused a delay in the domestic and overseas demand this month. The construction plans of various projects have begun to be scheduled. This allowed more room for bargaining and more time to consider, regarding the procurement of PV cells.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is US$0.077~ 0.085/W at the moment. The average price remains unchanged at US$0.080 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.101~ 0.107/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.111~ 0.120/W.

The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) is revised down to RMB 0.96 /W.
 
Modules
Compared with last week, the market prices of modules were more stable this week. China was still recovering from the outbreak. Little changes in the price were detected. Regarding the overseas market, the prices fluctuated as the raw materials were still tight and the transportation costs rising.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at US$0.195~ 0.229/W at the moment.

                                Price Trend: Excess Supply in Mono-Si Markets While Overseas Outbreak Development to Be Monitored                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200312-16603.html,"

 

The overall market was gradually stabilizing this week. The impact of the outbreak was slowly subsiding. The market prices were once again determined mostly by supply and demand. Judging from the changes in the global market, the supply chain was gradually getting back on track. The overseas markets were still under the impact of the outbreak. India and Japan were still in the peak season at the moment. Their demand continued to be stable at this stage. It is still uncertain regarding how the market will develop, as the outbreak unfolds.
Polysilicon
 The prices of polysilicon continued to maintain stability this week. The impact of the outbreak was gradually mitigated in China. The market supply and demand demonstrated more rational developments. As for the market supply, there might be a delay in terms of the additional manufacturing capacity that has been made available recently. The actual supply did not increase as expected. The market demand, on the other hand, has increased due to the rise in the labor return rate from the downstream. These developments in the supply and demand have resulted in stabilizing the prices. There were limited changes in overseas polysilicon. The prices changed as the exchange rate fluctuated.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 72~ 75/KG at the moment. The price range of polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 50~ 55/KG. The overseas price is lowered to US$8.77~ 9.28/KG. The average price is lowered to US$8.97 /KG. The global average price is lowered to US$8.82 /KG.
 
Wafers
 The prices of wafers remained stable this week. After the disruption from the outbreak waned, the mono-Si markets showed signs of pressure from excess supply. The said pressure has not led to price fluctuations, which does not guarantee the current stability of prices could be sustainable. Regarding the multi-Si products, the suppliers continued to increase supply to satisfy the market demand, which has stabilized the prices.
In the overseas market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.194~ 0.197/Pc at the moment. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at US$0.248 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.380~ 0.405/Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at US$0.423~ 0.430/Pc. The price range of the other large size products remains unchanged at US$0.430~ 0.530/Pc.

PV Cells
 The PV cell market showed similar developments to the wafer market this week. The excess supply in mono-Si products caused pressure which the small and medium-sized manufacturers cannot bear. There may be a price reduction in the short run. Meanwhile, multi-Si products suffered from insufficient actual supply and continued orders from the demand side of the market. This helped uphold the prices. Therefore were no excessive changes.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.077~ 0.085/W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.101~ 0.107/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.111~ 0.120/W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) remains unchanged at US$0.118~ 0.170/W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.57~ 0.59/W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.61/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.80~ 0.85/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.88~ 0.94/W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (> 21.7%) remains unchanged at RMB 0.89~ 0.94/W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) is revised up to RMB0.97 /W.
 
Modules
 The market price of modules continued to stabilize this week. China’s domestic demand remained weak. The only hope for the manufacturers was the module exports. There were certain regional markets with steady demand, namely India and Japan, which were in peak season and continued to restock. The local demand has not been affected by the outbreak for the time being. Therefore there were limited changes in demand.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at US$0.195~ 0.229/W at the moment. The average price has been lowered to US$0.203 /W. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) is revised up to US$0.205~ 0.238 /W. The average price is raised to US$0.219 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) remains unchanged at US$0.220~ 0.390/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) remains unchanged at US$0.223~ 0.350/W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) remains unchanged at US$0.226~ 0.390/W.
In the domestic market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.50~ 1.61/W. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.55~ 1.63/W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.67~ 1.70/W. 
 The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.68~ 1.75/W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.73~ 1.78/W.

                                Price Trend: Chinese Market Heats up as the Rest of the World Cools Down, Wafer Prices Are the First to Waver                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200319-16676.html,"


The markets in China and the rest of the world showed mixed developments this week. The Chinese market was gradually leaving the shadow of the outbreak behind. The market prices were once again determined mostly by supply and demand. As for the rest of the regional markets, the impact of the outbreak started to show as the outbreak spread. The installations in each region were affected to varying degrees. Judging from the changes in the global market, the Chinese market demand will continue until the end of 2020, on account of the outbreak subsiding and the support from the government. In the non-Chinese markets, however, the impact of the pandemic is expanding as the coronavirus outbreak escalates. The solar power industry is not completely shut down. Some of the projects may not be completed within this year.
 
Polysilicon
This week, the price of polysilicon has remained unchanged. The newly added supply capacity has not fully emerged. The existing supply has not been operational in all respects, either. The demand from the downstream was hampered by the relatively weak demand, which failed to drive up the prices from the upstream. As a result, the prices continued to remain stable. There were limited changes in overseas polysilicon. The prices changed as the exchange rate fluctuated.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 72~ 75/KG at the moment. The price range of polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 50~ 55/KG. The overseas price is lowered to US$8.68~ 9.19/KG. The average price is lowered to US$8.88 /KG. The global average price is lowered to US$8.73 /KG.
 
Wafers
The price of wafers began to show signs of crumbling this week. The mono-Si market was heating up steadily. The gap between the demand and supply was returning to the state before the pandemic. The multi-Si products were the first to drop prices, mainly because the overseas markets were expected to enter a state of emergency due to the outbreak. This will cause a short-term freeze in demand. Multi-Si wafer manufacturers have begun adjusting their strategy due to the new competitive landscape of the market.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is US$0.188~ 0.190/Pc at the moment. The price of black silicon products is lowered to US$0.245 /Pc. The range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer price revision is US$0.370~ 0.400/Pc. The range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) price revision is US$0.420~ 0.430/Pc. The price range of the other large size products remains unchanged at US$0.423~ 0.530/Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is RMB 1.46~ 1.53/Pc. The price of black silicon products remains unchanged at RMB 1.94 /Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.60~ 2.65/Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.99~ 3.07/Pc. The price range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at RMB 3.20~ 3.31/Pc. The price range of the 166.75 mm wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.35~ 3.47/Pc.
 
PV Cells
This week, the cell market was under pressure to reduce prices. Buyer stockpiling in the face of pandemic and the weak demand from the downstream were part of the source of pressure. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, some of the non-Chinese markets were entering a state of emergency, which made it even harder to determine the downstream demand. Even if the Chinese domestic market was heating up, it would take 2~3 weeks to drive up the prices. Although the multi-Si products had few changes in terms of the prices, they were still affected by the price pressure from the mono-Si market.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.077~ 0.085/W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.101~ 0.107/W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell price revision is US$0.114~ 0.119/W. The range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) price revision is USS$0.120~ 0.170USD/W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.57~ 0.59/W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.61 /W. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.80~ 0.85/W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell price revision is RMB 0.88~ 0.92/W. The range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (> 21.7%) price revision is RMB 0.90~ 0.93/W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) is revised down to RMB 0.96 /W.
 
Modules
The market prices of the modules remained stable this week. The Chinese domestic demand gradually increased as the coronavirus outbreak receded. A series of government policies were introduced to extend the deadlines of PV installations for this year. It is expected that the demand that normally emerges in Q2 would be extended to Q3 or even the end of 2020. Regarding the overseas market, various types of installations were impacted by the pandemic. The projects for utility-scale power plants were located in open areas. Therefore the impact was relatively limited. Rooftop or Commercial & Industrial projects were nonetheless under the impact of the outbreak, which led to slower progress in terms of installations.
In the overseas market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at US$0.195~ 0.229/W at the moment. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at US$0.205~ 0.238/W. The range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) price revision is US$0.213 ~0.390/W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) price revision is US$0.216~ 0.350/W. The range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) price revision is US$0.222~ 0.390/W.
In the domestic market, the price range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) remains unchanged at RMB 1.50~ 1.61/W.

                                Price Trend: M2 Wafer Prices Are Gradually Falling While Both the Demand and Supply Are Slowing Down                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200326-16750.html,"


This week, a wait-and-see sentiment was taking hold of the overall market, which was on the path to recovery. The demand and supply of the Chinese market have not yet returned to normal. As a result, the manufacturers were reluctant to expand their production even if they have enough manufacturing capacity. The overseas market was impacted by the COVID-19, which led to the free fall of the overall demand. The nationwide lockdown imposed by several governments has made it difficult for the supply chain to respond immediately. Judging from the changes in the global market, it could take 2 to 4 weeks for the market to return to normal. The market could only hope for moderate growth at this stage, provided that the coronavirus pandemic would be eradicated.
Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon remained unchanged this week. Under the impact of the increasing inventory level of the downstream, the overall supply chain suffered from excessive inventory. This led to the slowing down of transactions between the links of the supply chain. The industry players were more inclined to wait and observe the emerging market trends before they make their next move. As a result, there would not be much changes in the short term. It is estimated that the inventory would have to be digested before any meaningful changes would take place.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 72~ 75/KG at the moment. The price range of polysilicon remains unchanged at RMB 50~ 55/KG. The overseas price is lowered to US$8.63~ 9.13/KG. The average price is lowered to US$8.83 /KG. The global average price is lowered to US$8.68 /KG.
Wafers
The prices of some wafers started to fluctuate due to the impact of the rising level of inventory and the slowing down of the downstream demand. The prices of multi-Si products continued to decline slowly. The suppliers could adjust the manufacturing capacity accordingly, so that the prices would remain stable. The prices of the traditional mono-Si M2 products began to decline slowly. This was chiefly due to the abundant supply in the market, which, in turn, motivated the small- and medium-sized manufacturers to quote lower prices. The market also expected that the average contract prices announced at the end of this month would be on the decline. This led to the price slashing in certain products, whereas the large size products remained immune to the competitive pricing pressure.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is US$0.180~ 0.188/Pc at the moment. The price of black silicon products is lowered to US$0.243 /Pc. The range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer price revision is US$0.370~ 0.395/Pc. The average price is lowered to US$0.388 /Pc. The price range of the large size wafer (158.75 mm) remains unchanged at US$0.420~ 0.430/Pc. The range of the other large size product price revision is US$0.423~ 0.440/Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is RMB 1.45~ 1.51/Pc. The price of black silicon products remains unchanged at RMB 1.94 /Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer remains unchanged at RMB 2.60~ 2.65/Pc. The range of the 156.75 mm mono-Si wafer price revision is RMB 2.95~ 3.07/Pc. The average price is lowered to RMB 3.05/Pc. The range of the large size mono-Si wafer (158.75 mm) price revision is RMB 3.25~ 3.31/Pc. The price range of the 166.75 mm wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.35~ 3.47/Pc. 
PV Cells
The PV cell market showed a slowdown in supply and demand this week. The weak demand, which the market has long feared, was yet to be improved. Some manufacturers have also slowed down their production. The prices have nevertheless decreased, which was still within the market expectation.
In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.077~ 0.085/W at the moment. The price range of the general mono-Si cell remains unchanged at US$0.101~ 0.107/W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell price revision is US$0.112~ 0.119/W.

The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) is revised up to RMB 0.98/W.
Modules
Continuing the trend from last week, the module market prices still maintained stable this week. The impact of the pandemic on the overseas markets was worse than expected. It is estimated that it would be difficult to increase the demand in the coming 2 to 4 weeks. China was still affected by the delay in transportation and logistics. The overall labor return rate has gradually improved. However, it was still a long way from business as usual. 
In the overseas market, the range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) price revision is US$0.191~ 0.229/W at the moment. The price range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) remains unchanged at US$0.205~ 0.238/W. The range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) price revision is US$0.209~ 0.390/W.

Polysilicon
This week the prices started to show signs of fluctuations. Only a few days into the second quarter, it could already be seen that the situation, where the demand was delayed, was getting more serious due to the overseas COVID-19 pandemic. The prices of the polysilicon were also affected by the decrease in the prices quoted by the mono-Si wafer manufacturers. Although the polysilicon manufacturers were willing to concede on price, the buyers nonetheless were slow to place orders due to their expectation that the prices would decline further. They have adopted a wait-and-see attitude and do not place orders until the last minute.
Wafers
The prices of wafers continued to decline. The volatility of the PV cell market has exerted pressure on the utilization rate of the wafers, especially the multi-Si products. The top-tier manufacturers could still defend their price while the second- and third-tier manufacturers could not. And in order to make the sale, some of the sale prices were as low as RMB 1.2 /pc. The overall transaction volume was relatively low. Regarding the mono-Si products, responding to the weakening demand, a small portion of manufacturers have discontinued their production. The overall supply was nevertheless quite sufficient.
PV Cells
Shortly after the Tomb Sweeping Festival, the sell-off of the PV cell inventory was getting more and more rampant, which was mainly due to the impact of overseas pandemics. Due to the delay of the overall demand in the US and European markets, manufacturers kept demanding the delivery to be delayed or simply canceled the orders. And it was becoming evident that the preferences of overseas markets were shifting from M2 to G1. The cell manufacturers were finding it hard to export and had to resort to sell-off. India, usually a big market for the multi-Si products, could not give the market a much-needed boost, due to the coronavirus lockdown. Consequently, the prices of multi-Si products continued their downward trajectory.
Modules
Although the prices of modules were on a slow downward slide this week, the overall transaction volume was measly. The overseas demand plummeted, which made delayed deliveries the order of the day. The demand was limited in both China and the rest of the world, resulting in deeply pessimistic market sentiment. Throughout the module supply chain, the overall supply was already adequate, which put the prices under even greater pressure. The polarization in terms of the prices quoted by the top and 2nd-tier manufacturers was becoming more and more evident: Already vulnerable to the price pressure, the 2nd- or 3rd-tier manufacturers all lowered their prices to clear inventory, given that the overseas customers demanded order cancellations or delayed deliveries. However, their progress was still slow. The pandemic in the European and American markets has not yet reached the peak at the moment, coupled with the obviously weakening demand, it is estimated that the prices of modules will continue to fall.

The overall market prices were still in a downward trajectory this week. The current supply chain in China was back to normal. However, both the demand in China and the rest of the world were still far from normal.  After the pandemic-induced lockdown was lifted in China, the actual construction progress of the projects was not as fast as the labor return rate of the manufacturing sector, despite receiving support from the policy.

It is estimated that the market’s wait-and-see sentiment could last until May. Regarding the overseas market, only after the pandemic has eased, the recovery of the market can commence, the people can get back to the workforce. Judging from the current situation, things may return to normal in May. Given the changes in the global market, it is highly improbable for the buyers to detect the trend of incremental changes in the market before the coronavirus crisis is resolved. The suppliers have outstripped their customers in terms of recovering from COVID-19, which put the PV manufacturers under increasing pressure.
Polysilicon
This week, the price plunge of polysilicon saw no end in sight. The market felt the anticipatory anxiety under the pressure of the epidemic. The prices dropped both in China and the rest of the world, especially the polysilicon prices, which were almost as low as the cost of production. If the companies continue to reduce the price blindly, it may make it difficult for them to remain in business. It is estimated that this wave of price drop may cause a major shuffle in the supply chain.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of mono-grade polysilicon is revised down to RMB 65~69 /KG at the moment. The price range of polysilicon is revised down to RMB 42~ 45/KG. The overseas price range is revised down to US$7.54~ 8.17/KG. The global average price is lowered to US$8.12 /KG.
Wafers
The wafer market was in the middle of new product transitioning this week. The fierce competition between mono-Si 156.75 mm M2 wafers and 158.75 G1 was almost identical to the one between the mono- and multi-Si wafers a few years ago. With the introduction of new transition products and the current excess supply in the market, the price reductions in various products were quite considerable. Multi-Si products were still not favored by the market. The prices continued to fall as a result.
In the overseas market, the range of the multi-Si wafer price revision is US$0.163~ 0.170/Pc at the moment. The price of black silicon products is lowered to US$0.214 /Pc. The price range of the 156.75 mm M2 mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at US$0.370 ~ 0.388/Pc. The price range of the 158.75 mm G1 mono-Si wafer is revised down to US$0.378~ 0.390/Pc. The range of other large-size product price revision is US$0.405~ 0.415/Pc.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the multi-Si wafer is revised down to RMB 1.25 ~ 1.32/Pc. The price of black silicon products is lowered to RMB 1.70/Pc. The price range of the cast-mono wafer is lowered to RMB 2.55~ 2.58/Pc. The range of the 156.75 mm M2 mono-Si wafer price revision is RMB 2.75~ 2.95/Pc. The price range of the 158.75 mm G1 mono-Si wafer remains unchanged at RMB 3.07~ 3.25/ Pc. The range of the other large size product price revision is RMB 3.20~ 3.33/Pc.
PV Cells
Due to the lack of the rebounding surge in demand from the downstream, the cell market prices continued to hit new lows this week. The major manufacturers have been expanding their manufacturing capacity, which posed a threat to the production cost of other medium and smaller manufacturers. This has forced these companies to resort to selling-off to fight for the market share. If the demand does not improve within a month, this may initiate a supply chain shuffle.
In the overseas market, the range of the general multi-Si cell price revision is US$0.070~ 0.085/Pc at the moment. The range of the general mono-Si cell price revision is US$0.100~ 0.104/W. The range of high-efficiency mono-Si cell price revision is US$0.105~ 0.110/W. The range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (>21.7%) price revision is US$ 0.110~ 0.170/W.
In the Chinese domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.55~ 0.56/W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.57/W. The range of the general mono-Si cell price revision is RMB 0.78~ 0.83/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cell remains unchanged at RMB 0.83~ 0.86/W. The range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cell (> 21.7%) price revision is RMB 0.87~ 0.91/W. The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.7%) is revised up to RMB 0.96/W.
Modules
This week, the module manufacturers were forced to compete in the Chinese domestic market due to the slowing overseas demand and the increase in freight rates. However, the Chinese domestic market has not completely returned to normal. The inventory level of module manufacturers has been steadily on the rise. Judging from the current situation, it is estimated that this round of price reductions will continue for at least 2 to 4 weeks.
In the overseas market, the range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) price revision is US$0.189~ 0.210/W at the moment. The range of the 72-cell high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) price revision is US$0.195~ 0.240/W. The price range of the general mono-Si (305W-310W) is revised down to US$0.206~ 0.365/W. The range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) price revision is US$0.210~ 0.335/W. The range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>320W) price revision is US$0.217~ 0.385/W.
In the domestic market, the range of the 60-cell general multi-Si (275W-280W) price revision is RMB 1.46~ 1.55/W.

Although the prices from the global supply chain continued to fall, the Taiwanese market was still relatively stable in the global market. However, the market was still not entirely booming due to the problems that have existed for a long time.

Land consolidations
Slow review process
The feeder line has not been completely released.

EPC contractors still hoped that Taiwan’s module manufacturers could reduce the prices further. However, judging from the current market dynamics, where the top-tier manufacturers still need to deliver large orders, the extent of the price reduction space is limited. The remaining manufacturers are affected by the 2-month-extension of the grid connection deadline. As a result, there was only one wave of restocking in March. In April, the restocking was suspended temporarily. The extent of price reductions will also depend on the size of the projects. However, if the revenue of the module manufacturers does not improve by the end of April, the prices could be reduced further to stimulate the demand.
The inverter market dynamic was relatively slow. The price fluctuations were rather limited. However, the quoted price would still depend on the size of the project to determine the overall price. Although Taiwan’s demand for the overall PV installations may fall in 2020Q3. The stage for the battle of 1500V is expected to take place in the 2nd half of 2020.
Global Market Trend
Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon continued to decrease this week due to the delay in downstream demand. Judging from the current market situation, the pandemic has deepened its impact on the overall the Chinese domestic supply chain. The prices of China’s polysilicon market continued to decline. The low point of mono-grade polysilicon has fallen below RMB 60. The average price has been reduced to RMB 61 /KG. The supply of the polysilicon manufacturers was sufficient. However, there was not much room for price bargaining due to the demand cooling down.
Wafers
The major top-tier manufacturers lowered the price of wafers again on last week. The price reduction intensified the panic of the market, which resulted in the downward spiral in the overall wafer prices. Given that the top-tier manufacturers were facing weak demand from the downstream, the B- and C-list manufacturers were also forced to lower prices, hoping to send the shipments as soon as possible to reduce the load of production. This move will put the subsequent shipments under more pressure. The sinking mono-Si wafer prices have further reduced the market size of the multi-Si wafers. There was a wave of blind dumping in the multi-Si markets, where some of the quoted prices were as low as RMB 1 /Pc. However, the lowered price still could not stimulate the growth of orders.
PV Cells
Due to the substantial prices reduction of top-tier PV cell manufacturers, the overall market prices of PV cells have been lowered in sync. The average price of superior high-efficiency mono-Si PV cells (> 21.7%) has dropped to RMB 0.82 /W. Due to the price adjustment in the wafer market, there was also room for adjustment in the cell market. The impact of this round of price fluctuations on the expansion plans of the manufacturers will materialize incrementally. Regarding the multi-Si market, the situation did not inspire optimism due to the stagnant orders. As multi-Si cells began to be priced by cell, there was limited room for price reduction. The extent of decrease was relatively small. It is estimated that the market demand will still be sluggish. The inventory level of PV cell manufacturers will pose a bigger challenge as time wears on. In response to the changing market dynamics, manufacturing capacity reduction may be necessary.
Modules
During this time of the year, it is usually the time to negotiate the orders for May. However, due to the impact of the global pandemic, the market demand for modules was still as weak as last week, where very few orders were signed. As the upstream links kept decreasing the prices, each link was feeling the pressure of the rising inventory. Consequently, it was hard to be optimistic about the prices of modules. Their prices continued its downward trajectory. Prices were quoted occasionally. However, the sellers were still more eager than the buyers. Regarding the supply side, the majority of the module manufacturers have not been able to negotiate orders for May yet. In the Chinese domestic market, the demand for large-scale projects has emerged. The bidding prices of the successful bids continued to hit new lows. The profit margin of module manufacturers was already quite narrow.

Polysilicon 
The continuous declination for the prices of the polysilicon market during April has finally slowed down at the end of the month, which is primarily due to the relatively weak demand for domestic and overseas end markets, as well as the fact that some enterprises did not implement overhaul as planned. Under an overall sufficient supply of polysilicon, the prices will continue to decline.
Regarding the current market status, a number of enterprises are starting to implement overhaul in late April, and the reduction in the supply of silicon will slow down the price declination. Most enterprises are signing the orders for May this week, with most of them being monocrystalline silicons. Although enterprises are anticipating a persistence in price reduction, the degree of diminishment is expected to decelerate further. As for polysilicon, the order volumes remain  insignificant due to the impact from weak downstream demand.
Wafers
The MoM changes in the prices of the overall wafer market this week has dropped after several weeks of price shrinkage. As a minority of Chinese projects are beginning to initiate in May, together with the expected lifting of lockdown in India, as well as the positive outlook from the gradually recuperated demand in the European and American markets, the wafer prices have stopped declining under the anticipated slight increase in downstream PV cells. It is expected that the sales of wafer inventory will accelerate in May.
PV Cells
The market prices for PV cells have increased moderately as a result of the recuperated demand. With the commencement of domestic projects, as well as the minor inventory draw derived from 630, the ASP of high-efficiency mono-si PV cells (>21.7%) remains at 0.82RMB/pc. Due to the recent prices for PV cells approaching the cost price, the prices for PV cells are expected to increase once again next week under the invigoration of the demand, especially with the apparent increase of the order volume in May for first-tier manufacturers.
Modules 
Under the anticipated ascension in domestic and overseas demand, the prices for photovoltaic modules this week are expected to stop falling. Large-scale projects have been successively initiated in the domestic market since late April, and the intensity in inventory restocking is expected to magnify beginning from May. In regard to the overseas market, several countries and regions have or are in the midst of adequately relaxing on the restrictions for traffic and logistics, where a recovery has been seen in the market demand under the economic reboot. The overall volume of module orders in May is expected to increase progressively, though the degree of price elevation will not be monumental after the bounce back.

Taiwan’s Market Update: The Module Market Is Recovering
In April, the Taiwan market—from modules, inverters all the way to the downstream system—was dull and almost stagnant. It is estimated that the demand for restocking modules will slowly improve in May. The demand for restocking will peak in mid-June. In April, the overall market price of modules was practically stuck, where the price cannot rise or fall. In May and June, where the grid-connection deadlines are approaching, a small rush of restocking will emerge as a result. However, Taiwan’s overall demand for installation is likely to emerge in the third quarter. Judging from the current situation, it seems difficult to meet the targeted annual new installation of 2.2 GW now.

Polysilicon
As the demand improved, the recovery rippled across the entire supply chain. The prices of polysilicon have shown signs of slowing down in their decline. Overall, the extent of decline has further narrowed in comparison with the previous week. There are 3 polysilicon manufacturers carrying out repairs and equipment maintenance at the moment. The accumulated inventory can be digested temporarily due to the output reduction of polysilicon. This, however, does not signify an improvement in the actual demand. The current improvement in demand only slightly mitigates the impasse which supply and demand were initially facing. The key to the actual recovery of the market is still the balance between supply and demand. Only when both of the domestic and overseas market demand improve simultaneously, and the production is dropped substantially, will the prices stop falling and stabilize.
Wafers
The overall wafer market prices showed a flattened trend this week. As the demand in May emerged, the mono-Si wafers are affected by the recovering demand of the downstream, the prices may rebound in the foreseeable future. However, in fact, the excess supply has not been fixed. The current market situation depends on whether there are urgent orders in the third quarter. On the other hand, it also depends on the progress of the top-tier wafer manufacturers investing in downstream projects, aiming to drive up their own wafer shipments. Given that new production capacity of some wafers is becoming available, only a combination of increased demand and tightened supply may stop the price from plunging further and get it to climb back up again.
Cells
After the top-tier manufacturers tried to increase the quoted price and made the sale before China’s Labor Day holiday, the PV cell prices began to rebound slightly. The B- and C-list manufacturers followed suit this week, albeit with limited rate of increase, which was around RMB 0.02 /W. As the pandemic eased in some parts of the world and the PV developers rushed to install the UHV and close the carryover projects from the previous reporting period, the average price of high-efficiency mono-Si PV cells has been slightly increased to RMB 0.780. The cell, on the other hand, is still riding a rising tide in the short term.
Modules
As the US, Italian, French and other countries are attempting to resume work in May, overseas orders are gradually increasing. And China's June-30 deadline is slowly approaching, which also starts driving demand in some parts of the market. High-efficiency modules, in particular, benefit from this increased demand, which helps shore up their prices. Regarding the companies, a pattern has already emerged before the Labor Day holiday: the distribution of orders are clearly divided, but not evenly. Most orders were concentrated in the top-tier manufacturers, whereas the quotations of B- and C-list manufacturers got a lukewarm reception. The demand remains unchanged for them. Meanwhile, whether or not the overseas PV projects can resume operation on time still needs to be closely monitored. Additionally, pandemic relapses are a genuine risk, to which careful attention should be given.

Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon in all regional markets could not be stabilized and continued its downward trajectory this week. Due to the recovery in the market demand in China, the recent decline in the prices of polysilicon has narrowed. However, a wait-and-see sentiment was taking hold of the wafer companies due to the price reductions of major wafer manufacturers last week. The wafer companies were slow to place orders for polysilicon. To relieve the pressure on inventory, the polysilicon manufacturers with limited bargaining power tend to lower the price to make the sale. This move drove down the average price of China’s polysilicon for multi-usage, which was RMB 38/KG. It is expected that the prices of polysilicon will continue to decline.
Wafers
The 630-deadline has brought on a small rush of restocking. However, the overall supply chain still suffered from excess supply. The public was baffled about the decision of leading wafer manufacturers to continue their price reductions. The reason was simply to increase market share through price reductions, which could maintain their profitability. Judging from the fact that the end-of-month average contract price from major wafer manufacturers has been on the downward slide for 3 months in a row, the market demand was still weak. It is estimated that the prices of wafers will remain weak next week.
PV Cells
This week, the overall prices of PV cells barely maintained their stability. The average prices of superior-efficient mono-Si cells fell to US$0.1 /W in non-Chinese markets. Affected by wafer makers’ price downward revisions, the cells only managed to stop the price decline, even though cells were deemed as bullish and very likely to rise. The 630-deadline is slowly approaching. The European market and emerging markets are on their ways to recovery. However, the top-tier manufacturers also continue to expand their manufacturing capacity of high-efficiency cells. The market is expected to experience excess supply again. The prices of the cells may continue to be revised down.
Modules
Due to the ever-sinking bid prices of projects, the prices of modules continued to fall. This week, the big and small companies were facing very different markets. There was a distinct difference between the orders received for top-tier and B-list manufacturers. The industry leaders have a steady stream of orders, whereas the small and medium manufacturers were struggling in this regard. Plus, the price reductions of the upstream players did not help the matters, either. The overall quoted prices of small and medium businesses were weak with increasingly weak bargaining power.

Taiwan’s Market Update: Module Factories Cut Prices to Boost Sales
This week, the EPC contractors in Taiwan’s PV market have finally shown attempts of boosting their sales. As the grid connection deadline, which was delayed for 2 months, was approaching, modules were sent to all the project sites for installations. The module manufacturers were slashing their prices to boost sales. The price of mainstream modules, which has long been locked in at US$0.335 /W, has started to drop to US$0.33 /W. Although the decline was not large, it was clear that the market was no longer stagnant. A small wave of installations was emerging. It is estimated that the peak time for restocking in the first half of 2020 will be in mid-June.

Polysilicon
This week, the overall sales volume of polysilicon was relatively low. And the trend of quoted prices roughly showed the same pattern as last week. The sales volume was relatively lower this week, because most orders in May were signed in early May. And the orders in June will not be discussed until next week. Some of the urgent orders will be negotiated on case-by-case basis, which would see the sale prices landing on the lower end of the market. Compared with the overall downward trend of polysilicon prices last week, the global polysilicon prices showed only a slight dip this week, with an average price of US$7.082 /KG. Lately, polysilicon manufacturers have adjusted their production schedules. They are 7 companies all over the world that are undergoing their facility maintenance at the moment. Companies such as Tongwei, East Hope, Daqo have shifted their maintenance plans to June. The inventory of polysilicon was gradually digested, on account of China’s 630-deadline impacting the polysilicon side as well as the reduction in polysilicon supply in the overall market. The supply and demand in the polysilicon market would not change much in the short term.
Wafers
The wafer market continued to fluctuate this week, and the overall prices fell slightly. Stimulated by the sharp price reduction of mono-Si wafers in the early stage, the downstream demand for the mainstream products has recovered to some extent. However, overseas demand has not recovered, which made it difficult to fix the excess supply. Consequently, the mono-Si wafer prices in the Chinese market were still falling this week. The average price of G1 mono-Si wafers was adjusted to RMB 2.62 /pc. And the average price of large-size mono-Si wafers was reduced to RMB 2.8 /pc. Concerning the multi-Si wafers, the prices have not improved, which was almost approaching the manufacturers’ cost of production. There has been a stream of reports about the quoted prices, which range from RMB 1 to 1.1 /pc. Some companies are even considering ending the current manufacturing capacity or transforming their business models.
PV Cells
This week, most of the quoted prices remained stable, with the exception of the overly high quotes coming back down to the baseline. Owing to India’s lockdown being extended to the end of May, coupled with a perpetually weak demand, the price difference between the mono- and multi-Si cells has been more than RMB 0.2 /W. Regarding the mono-Si cells, the quoted prices of upstream wafers have been slipping. However, the quoted prices of top-tier manufacturers with bargaining power could remain reasonable on account of the support from the downstream demand. This has anchored the cells (>21.7%) at RMB 0.8 /W. In the short term, the demand for some top-tier companies is improving. And the orders for June has already maxed out their manufacturing capacity.
Modules
The module prices continued to fall, but the overall decline has narrowed at the moment. Due to the sufficient supply of modules in the Chinese market, coupled with the overall overseas market demand remaining weak in May, the module market was suffering from an excess supply. However, the module prices have basically stopped plummeting in the Chinese market by virtue of the improvement in China’s domestic market and the recovering demand for high-efficiency modules. Regarding the non-Chinese markets, in the light of the traditional markets such as Europe and U.S. were returning to work in phases, the current average price of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315-320W) modules remained at US$ 0.25 /W. However, the market aggregate demand is not yet clear. And the businesses were more cautious when it comes to the overseas short-term orders. The > 325W / > 385W module prices continue to decline to US$0.26 /W, as a result.
It is noteworthy that Jinko, JA Solar and other manufacturers have all released 500W + high-power modules based on large-size wafers lately. Although the product sizes and technical specifics of each manufacturer are slightly different, there is not much difference in terms of the overall module specifications and performance. In the future, the industrial concentration of modules may further increase.

Polysilicon
Impacted by the downward trend of mono-Si wafer prices, a wait-and-see sentiment has taken a firm hold of the polysilicon market this week. Judging from the situation of the polysilicon market at the end of May, there were some polysilicon companies raising their quoted prices. The overall polysilicon price trend has generally stabilized as a result. Some wafer companies, on the other hand, were pressuring the polysilicon manufacturers to cut prices when purchasing raw material. However, this was more widespread among the B-list manufacturers, which has pushed the mono-grade polysilicon down to RMB 55 /KG.
Looking ahead, the prices of polysilicon are expected to rebound in June. Given that the polysilicon manufacturers are gradually digesting their inventories, some Chinese manufacturers have carried out maintenance according to the plan and the supply of polysilicon was disrupted due to the maintenance plans of the non-Chinese polysilicon manufacturers.
Wafers
Due to the industry leader of wafers slashing prices again on Monday, the market’s pressure to reduce the price was increased again this week. Across the entire PV supply chain, the overall wafer market was experiencing the most fluctuations. The mainstream products have been further pressured. The average price of G1 has fallen to RMB 2.53 /pc. The large-size mono-Si wafers (> 158.75mm) declined the most. The price difference between the two has narrowed to RMB 0.02 /pc.
Given that the overall wafer prices continued to be revised downward, the boron-doped mono-Si wafers and multi-Si wafers with weak demand will bear the brunt in the future, especially the multi-Si products. The current multi-Si wafer quoted prices have fallen below the cost of production of some companies. Manufacturers said that it has been difficult to keep the business running since the pandemic broke out. The free fall of mono-Si wafer prices has made it impossible for the multi-Si manufacturers to continue the production. Lately, multi-Si manufacturers have all been considering if they should suspend the production. In contrast, mono-Si wafers still have room to keep slashing their prices. Even after the most recent price adjustment, it is possible the industry leader of mono-Si wafers still has not reached the rock bottom. Some companies believe that as long as the price reduction can stimulate demand, they may follow suit and cut their prices.
PV Cells
The cell prices continued to fluctuate this week. The market quotations were chaotic. Suffering blows from the price reduction of wafers and the reduction of quoted prices from top-tier cell manufacturers, multi-Si cells with weak demand has once again hit the bottom. Their prices seemed to have bottomed out, however, there was indeed still room for price reductions. The average price of China’s multi-Si cells has slipped to RMB 0.5 /W. India, the main overseas market for multi-Si cells, does not inspire much optimism these days. The tender dates of multiple photovoltaic projects have been extended to mid-June. The future development of the local market still needs to be carefully observed.
Concerning the mono-Si cells, the leading companies have signed the purchase orders for June. The manufacturing capacity was tight. Consequently their bargaining power has not been affected. However, B- or C-list manufacturers with weak bargaining power were struggling to defend their quoted price for the orders in June. The quoted prices were obviously open for negotiation. And the cell prices continued to sink.
Modules
The global market prices of modules was still on a downward trend this week.  And the decline in overseas mono- and multi-Si modules was more obvious. Lately, the module market prices were struggling to maintain stability, given that the non-Chinese market demand was slow to recover. The non-Chinese average price of > 325W /> 385W mono-Si modules has plunged to US $ 0.22 /W.
The Chinese market has reserved 47 GW of storage space for photovoltaic development in 2020. Coupled with the approaching 630-deadline, the short-term change in demand is supposed to warrant a certain degree of optimism. However, the overall module quoted prices remained on a downward trajectory, which was mainly caused by a severe case of excess supply. The companies were fighting over limited orders, which led to price wars. Judging from the recent auction results, it was obvious that the prices of modules continued to hit new lows. The bids with modules made of large-size wafers were mostly successful. It is obvious that there is an upward shift in terms of the module efficiency.

Taiwan’s Market Update:
Due to the price reduction of the top-tier wafer makers in China last week, the cell market prices all plummeted in Taiwan this week. Only G1 cells in Taiwan could remain at US$0.15 /W. The prices of the other cell sizes were forced to be lowered. Overall, the prices fell between US$0.13~ 0.14/W. Although the prices of the PV cells fell this week, it did not affect the modules, mainly because the PV system integrators were trying to make the grid connection deadline by the end of the month. Consequently the module purchase order has been signed in May. It is estimated that the impact of the cell prices would manifest in the module quoted prices after mid-June.The average price of G1 module fell to US$0.33~ 0.34/W, and the price of M4 module exceeded US$0.37/W this week.
Polysilicon
This week, the prices of polysilicon have generally stabilized. Only the prices quoted by a few polysilicon manufacturers have fluctuated. Impacted by the last round of price cuts in the supply chain, the prices of polysilicon have bottomed out. Given that the mono-grade polysilicon was traded at less than RMB 60 /KG, the profitability of operational manufacturers has been constantly compressed. Only the manufacturing capacity of businesses located in areas, where the electricity prices were lower, had relative cost advantages.
Beginning in early June, the Chinese top- and second-tier manufacturers continued to carry out facility and equipment maintenance, and overseas manufacturers also followed suit. Consequently, China has imported and produced less polysilicon. The pressure of supply and demand has been much alleviated, The sale price in the overall market will stabilize. It is estimated that the prices of polysilicon will remain stable and increase slightly under the stimulus of 630 demand, coupled with the overseas markets opening up to one after another and the rising overall market demand in June.
Wafers
This week, the decline of overall wafer prices narrowed. The prices of large-size products remained stable. Following the price reductions made by leading wafer manufacturers last week, most wafer companies have also adjusted their quoted prices one after another. A small number of companies have quoted their prices slightly lower in order to secure orders for June. Overall, the price reduction of G1 mono-Si wafer narrowed RMB to 2.28-2.45 /pc, and the average price fell to RMB 2.5 /pc. Meanwhile, large-size products are heating up at the moment. The supply of products on the market is still slowly recovering. The average price of large-size products was stable and stood at RMB 2.550 /pc this week.
Regarding multi-Si wafers, the market remained sluggish. Although the demand in the non-Chinese end markets were gradually heating up, the effect has yet to be made manifest in the segment of wafers, which is not enough to boost the price of wafers. Consequently, the average price of multi-Si wafers in the regional markets were driven down to RMB 1.180 /pc and US$0.144 /pc, respectively.
PV Cells
As the demand for multi- and mono-Si cells increased in the end market, the overall cell market maintained stable this week. In June, the global demand will continue to increase. Consequently the sale volume of mono- and multi-Si cells in the market has increased, especially the mono-Si cells. The order visibility has improved. The majority of the operation of the first-tier cell manufacturers was still delivering the standard purchase orders.
Regarding the multi-Si market, the price of multi-Si cells continued to fluctuate around RMB 0.5 /W this week. Although the Chinese market demand has recovered, India, the main non-Chinese multi-Si market, has extended the national lockdown and curfew to the end of June. The market demand outlook still does not inspire much optimism. In addition, the market supply of superior high-efficiency PV cells was a bit tight. Although some companies tried to increase prices due to the tight supply, the overall sale prices, in fact have not fluctuated significantly. The average price this week remained at RMB 0.77 /W.
Modules
Across the entire supply chain, the module market price was the only one that was on the decline this week. Driven by China’s 630-deadline and overseas demand, the prices of first-tier makers were stable. However, the second- and third-tier companies reduced their prices in order to fight for the limited purchase orders. Therefore, the overall module market prices were on a slightly downward trajectory. These included the average price of general multi-Si (275W-280W) modules, which was reduced to RMB 1.4 /W, and the average price of high-efficiency mono-Si (315W-320W) modules was reduced to RMB 1.55 /W.
Meanwhile, as the recent PV projects were announced in China, it was obvious that the prices of various types and sizes of modules, which the module manufacturers would deploy in the auction projects, were on a downward trajectory. And the vertically integrated companies can guarantee the consumption of some modules through the construction of PV projects. This can also generate higher profitability for the module segment.

Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon generally were stabilized this week. At the moment most of the polysilicon manufacturers in the market have already secured orders for June. The sales this week was mostly replenishment in small volume. The sale prices were roughly the same as last week. Regarding the mono-grade polysilicon, the average price was only slightly reduced to RMB 57 /kg in the Chinese market.
Regarding the supply of polysilicon, 2 Chinese companies have completed their maintenance and repair after June. Meanwhile, the companies which planned to carry out the facility maintenance have delayed their plans. And the supply of polysilicon has risen in the short term, as a result. Despite the fact that the downstream segments seemed to be recovering, the polysilicon segment has yet to demonstrate any substantial increase in demand resulting from restocking activities.
Wafers
This week, the overall trend of wafer prices and sale volume are stabilized. Following the price adjustment of wafer manufacturers, the quoted prices of mono-Si wafers were generally stable this week. The demand for M6 wafers continues to inspire optimism, whereas the supply has not reached the level of stability yet. Consequently, in the Chinese market, the average price of wafers was stabilized at RMB 2.55 /pc. And in the non-Chinese markets, the average price was stabilized at US$0.315 /pc.
The prices of multi-Si wafers, on the other hand, were stable and ranged between RMB 1.08-1.52 /pc. However, due to the low demand, the overall operating rate was low. Notwithstanding the gradually decreasing market supply, the inventory was still digested slowly due to the weak demand.
PV Cells
The prices of PV cells showed a stable trend this week. Some quoted prices of multi-Si cells were showing signs of economic recovery, mainly due to the increased order visibility in the non-Chinese market. Plus, some projects involved multi-Si cells have been activated in the Chinese market. Overall, the market recovery of multi-Si cells was nevertheless not fast enough to get multi-Si cell manufacturers to resume production. A wait-and-see sentiment has taken hold of the majority of the market. Consequently, the average price of multi-Si cells was stable and remained at RMB 0.5 /W in the Chinese market this week.
Driven by the 630-deadline, the overall sale price and volume of mono-Si cells maintained stability. And the demand for 166mm solar cells was almost as high as the demand for G1 cells. After a wave of new manufacturing capacity becoming available in each segment of the supply chain in the second half of the year, the market demand will be even stronger for M6 cells. 
Modules
Regarding the supply chain, the module price market showed a slight downward trend this week. Judging from the recent successful bids of the project in the Chinese market, the overall quoted prices of modules continued to decline. With the preparation of the 630-projects coming to an end, coupled with low order visibility, these factors have created a temporary void in market demand. In order to maintain the operating rate, some companies continued to boost their sales by lowering their prices, which led to the price war in the market. Both of the prices of the multi- and mono-Si products continued to fall. The average prices of the general multi-Si (275W-280W) and the superior high- efficiency mono-Si (>320W/385W) modules have been slightly lowered to RMB 1.390 /W and RMB 1.620 /W, respectively at the moment. It is worth noting that the leading manufacturers of photovoltaic glass all postponed the date of production resumption and the commissioning of new production lines at this stage. Some manufacturers of the double-glass products, which were in short supply, have already tried to raise prices.
Regarding the non-Chinese markets, the United States and European countries were lifting the lockdown one after another. The pandemic in India and South America, on the other hand, was still spreading rapidly. The overall operation resumption in the market progressed at a more cautious pace. The lack of demand further drove the prices of the supply chain. The average price of the general mono-Si (305-310W) modules has dropped to US$0.26 /W at the moment. And in the non-Chinese market, the prices of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si (>320W/385W) have fallen by more than 5% from last week. And the average price dropped to US$0.206 /W.

Polysilicon
The prices of mono-grade polysilicon remained stable in the market this week. And the prices of multi polysilicon rose slightly. The Chinese polysilicon manufacturers were still in the middle of maintenance operations at the moment. And the supply was slightly tight. The polysilicon suppliers have tried to raise prices. However, they still could not successfully raise the overall market price.
There were fewer new orders for mono-grade polysilicon this week. The suppliers were mostly delivering the orders that were already in the pipelines. The quoted prices of the newly signed orders were also in line with the mainstream. Consequently, the prices of mono-grade polysilicon managed to be stabilized at RMB 55-58 /KG. The prices of multi polysilicon rebounded slightly. The main reason behind the rebound was the recovering demand in the Indian market, which increased the operating rate of the Chinese multi-Si wafer manufacturers. The prices of multi polysilicon rose slightly as a result. The demand was nevertheless not robust, prompting the average price to rebound to RMB 37 /KG.
Wafers
The prices of most wafers have remained generally stable this week, with the exception of the slight fluctuations in the price of G1 mono-Si wafers. The new orders for mono-Si wafers were showing signs of decline, as the rush installation induced by the 630-deadline was nearing its end, coupled with the fact that the new manufacturing capacity of mono-Si wafers was becoming available.
The supply of mono-Si wafers has gradually been inching towards excess supply in the market at the moment. The quoted prices of some small and medium-sized enterprises remained stable on the surface while declining in effect. This phenomenon was nonetheless still limited to a small number of orders, which did not get to affect the overall price. Therefore, the average prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers remained stable at RMB 2 /pc and RMB 2.55 /pc. The demand for multi-Si wafers recovered slightly, which had yet to cause the price to fluctuate in the short run. And the average price remained at RMB 1.18 /pc.
PV Cells
This week, the prices of PV cells remained stable. As the demand for multi-Si cells in overseas markets has begun to pick up recently, some companies were considering increasing their prices. However, this has not yet been reflected in the actual sale prices. The price range of multi-Si cells remained at RMB 0.51-0.48 /W this week, which was same as last week.
The mono-Si cells continued the same trend as last week. The top-tier companies have slightly increased the prices of a small number of rush orders. The sale price of G1 PV cells could be as high as RMB 0.84 /W, while the rest of quoted prices remained stable. At the moment, the average price of general mono-Si cells is RMB 0.710-0.760 /W. And the average price of M6 mono-Si cells is RMB 0.810 /W.
Modules
This week, module prices were still not improved with minor fluctuation in the lower price range. Regarding companies, the current top-tier manufacturers could still maintain a high operating rate. Hence, the price could be stabilized. On the other hand, second- and third-tier companies could only maintain a medium operating rate. They offer competitive prices to facilitate the deal. With the increasing demand for high-wattage modules in the market, the maturity of technology continued to drive the cost to new lows. Consequently, the prices of modules continued to decline, pushing the price of general multi-Si (275W-280W) modules to drop to RMB 1.34-1.4 /W. The low point of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si (>320W/385W) modules was revised down to RMB 1.55 /W. It is estimated that there will still be room for deduction in terms of subsequent quoted prices of the modules.
The non-Chinese markets, such as Southeast Asia and Japan, are generally stable at the moment. Europe’s postponed demand has gradually recovered after the production has resumed. Meanwhile, the declarations for China's photovoltaic auction project has ended. According to incomplete statistics in China, the declared projects have exceeded 30GW. The results of the review will be released within one month. Considering the majority of the auction projects is required to complete and connect to the grid by the end of the year, some of the demand is expected to emerge earlier than Q3. This will provide support for the downstream segment.
Note: Due to changes in market conditions, the quoted prices for high-efficiency mono-Si PV cells and superior high-efficiency mono-Si PV cells have been canceled. And the prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si PV cells have been added from June 17, 2020 onward.On June 25th, the prices across the supply chain will be released as usual. And the price trend commentary will be suspended for a week due to a public holiday.

Polysilicon
This week, the demand for multi and mono-grade polysilicon increased simultaneously. And the market price of polysilicon showed a slight rise. The market supply is tight at the moment, due to the equipment maintenance that have been implemented by polysilicon manufactures in 2020Q2. The polysilicon prices have increased slightly, due to the continued increase in demand from downstream wafer manufacturers and the fact that the orders for July have already been signed. The average price of multi polysilicon has been raised to RMB 38 /KG at the moment. And the average price of mono-grade polysilicon has been increased to RMB 57 /KG. The continuous expansion of wafer manufacturing capacity led by the 2 top wafer manufacturers has stimulated the steady growth of demand for polysilicon since the middle of the year. As the polysilicon manufacturers across the globe continue their facility maintenance, the upstream market will continue to maintain a precarious market equilibrium.

Wafers
Top-tier wafer manufacturers have announced the latest quoted prices for July. The quoted prices remained unchanged and the overall market prices were stabilized. As July arrived, most wafer manufacturers generally remained a high operating rate and were relatively aggressive in terms of procurement of the polysilicon, mainly due to the deadline extensions for some of the projects. 
It is estimated that the increase in demand can continue for more than one to two weeks. Regarding the multi-Si wafers, judging from the recovering demand in the non-Chinese markets, the market is generally optimistic. The demand is set to surge, once an appropriate stimulant presents itself.

PV Cells
Compared with other segments, the PV cells have been relatively stable recently. The overall market prices demonstrated a flattened trend. The first-tier cell manufacturers announced the quoted prices in July, which remained unchanged. The orders for July were also signed. The cell prices remained in a relatively narrow range: G1 mono-Si cells ranged between RMB 0.79 and 0.8 /W, and M6 mono-Si cells ranged between RMB 0.8 and 0.82 /W.
It is noteworthy that the demand for M6 cells has surpassed their G1 counterparts starting from July, although the sale volume of M6 and G1 cells was roughly on the same level in May. Whether G1 will exit the market at the end of this year will be the next focus of the market observation.

Modules
Although various markets around the globe have shown signs of recovery, the module prices remained on its slightly downward trajectory, with no end in sight at the moment. China announced the 2020 photovoltaic auction projects of 25.97 GW at the end of June. The distributed PV projects that made it into the finalist round accounted for only 1.3% of the total. Meanwhile, judging from the recently announced tender plan, 166mm products will provide much more demand for modules in the second half of the year. There is also demand of the end market for the 180-210mm products. In the future, the purchase orders will be secured by mostly the first-tier manufactures, while the 2nd- and 3rd-tier manufacturers fight over the leftover. This polarization will become more and more evident.

Most of the first-tier manufacturers have finalized orders for July at the moment, whereas the sale volume of the second- and third-tier manufacturers was still unstable. Lately, there were delayed projects that supported the market demand. However, the prices continued to fall due to excess supply. The average price of the high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W) modules in both Chinese and non-Chinese markets was reduced to RMB 1.39 /W and US$0.188 /W. And the average price of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315-320W) modules in both Chinese and non-Chinese markets was reduced to RMB 1.53 /W and US$0.190 /W.

Taiwan’s Market Update: The Amendments Made by the Council of Agriculture Set to Gravely Impact the Targeted Solar Installations
The Council of Agriculture recently set out to revise the regulation. In the future, there will be a strict control over the conversion of agricultural land to green power. For Taiwan’s budding solar energy market, this is a huge blow to every segment across the industry. 
Image by Samuel Faber from Pixabay
The existing 600 MW projects that have already undergone the conversion will not be affected for now. There are 1.5 GW projects that are under review, of which nearly 500 MW of PV projects are on project sites smaller than 4.792 acres. The said projects have been determined that they cannot be utilized. And the rest will be transferred to the central government for a review. Judging from deployment of the ground-mounted projects, the impact will not be small. Observing the overall market in Taiwan this year, the actual installed PV capacity may fall between 1 and 1.2GW of new PV installation, despite the original target of 2.2GW.
The quoted prices of modules and inverters are not affected for now, mainly because the current shipments are for the orders signed earlier. The impact of the Agricultural Committee’s revision of the policy is estimated to reflect on the prices of modules and inverters between 2020Q4 and 2021Q1.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon segment continued the same dynamic from last week, where the market prices had been corrected at a steady pace. This week, the new sale prices of polysilicon companies have increased slightly. The price range of mono-grade polysilicon has narrowed to RMB 57-61 /KG. And the average price has been raised to RMB 57 /KG. The main reason behind the increase owed to the fact that the new manufacturing capacity of downstream wafer companies has gradually become available, which led to an increase in the demand for polysilicon.
On the other hand, the downstream segments had a rising demand for high-quality polysilicon in 2020. And overseas polysilicon companies continued to maintain its facility and reduce production in the first half of the year. Plus, there are even more polysilicon manufacturers carrying out their facility maintenance in July. Therefore the market supply decreased further than expected The overall market supply continued to be tight, coupled with an increase in demand. The prices of polysilicon kept rising slightly as a result.
Wafers
The market demand for the overall wafer segment has gradually increased this week. And the wafer prices have remained stable. As July arrived, most of the first-tier companies have already signed the orders for July. The overall prices were stable. The demand inspired much optimism from the market. The price range of G1/M6 mono-Si wafers, in particular, remained between RMB 2.38-2.53 /pc and RMB 2.45-2.62 /pc, respectively. The operating rate of the corresponding wafer companies remained the same as before.
Regarding the multi-Si wafers, the demand for low-efficiency wafers has not yet emerged, while the demand for medium- and high-efficiency wafers somewhat recovered. The market was still sluggish. The prices have been hovering around RMB 1.180 /pc in the past month.
Cells
The market demand for cells has been emerging since June. And the prices of cells continued to inspire optimism this week. The overall cell market is in short supply at the moment. The orders for July have already been signed in June. Around the beginning of July, major manufacturers have begun to negotiate orders for August. Regarding mono-Si cells, the demand for M6 was strong due to China’s large-scale domestic projects. Still, the demand for G1 was weak. According to the feedback from some manufacturers, G1 wafers enjoyed a relatively large bargaining space. The price difference between G1 and M6 was RMB 0.02 /W.
The large-size wafers have been driving the upgrade of the product structure of the supply chain. The 500W+ high-power products of the first-tier module companies have made their market debut one after another by the beginning of July. It is expected that the downstream developers could be further encouraged to adopt and deploy this type of products in the future, accelerating the cell product rollover.
Modules
The module prices remained on its slightly downward trajectory, but the decline has narrowed. Regarding the module price trend, the overseas market prices of the modules basically have not changed much. Owing to the gradual emergence of new manufacturing capacity of the modules in the Chinese market, coupled with the fact that the sale prices of modules for large-scale photovoltaic projects have dragged the overall market prices down, the mono-Si module prices showed a slight decline in the Chinese market as a result. The prices of the high-efficiency mono-Si (315-320W) and superior high-efficiency mono-Si (>320W/385W), in particular, fell RMB 0.01 /W each. And their average prices fell to RMB 1.52 /W and RMB 1.54 /W. Some companies were worried that the sellers will be much more enthusiastic than the buyers in the near future. However, the first-tier module companies can still maintain a high operating rate. It is estimated that the prices of modules will slowly stabilize in the future.
Observing the non-Chinese markets in recent times, the pandemic in the U.S. is surging back up, which caused more than 10 states to postpone their reopening plans. Among the emerging markets, the pandemic has been easing in Chile. The pressure nevertheless continued to persist in Brazil, India and other countries. In the future, it is still necessary to closely pay attention to the market risks involving demand fluctuations, which have been caused by the pandemic development in these countries.

Polysilicon
This week, the overall prices of polysilicon have increased significantly. Both multi and mono-grade polysilicon were in excess demand in the market. Regarding the multi polysilicon, due to the recent supply problems of multi polysilicon manufacturers, the supply of multi polysilicon was tight. However, this was only temporary. In the long run, the price of multi polysilicon has limited room for recovery. As of mid-July, the price of multi polysilicon has increased by more than 10% from the market price in June. And the average price has climbed to RMB 39/KG this week. The mono-grade polysilicon price increased because the manufacturing capacity of downstream wafer manufacturers has been becoming available, which led to an increase in demand for polysilicon. Both the highest and lowest prices of mono-grade polysilicon in the market have increased by RMB 2/KG, which made the price range between RMB 59-63/KG. The average price rose to RMB 60/KG this week.
For the overseas market of polysilicon, the market price rose to US$6.7-7/KG due to the increase in the price of Chinese polysilicon and the delay of companies in the production resumption. The global polysilicon price has exceeded US$7 per kg, and the average price has increased to US$7.175/KG at the moment.
Wafers
This week, the wafer market prices were generally stable. The prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers continued to trade sideways at RMB 2.5/pc and RMB 2.55/pc. The upstream polysilicon market has rebounded in the past two weeks. And the downstream cell market was in short supply. Therefore prices have risen slightly, making wafer manufacturers eager to increase prices. However, there was no significant increase in the transaction volume of the mono-Si wafer market at the moment. The shipments of manufacturers have remained stable. And the actual sale prices have not yet shown a clear upward trend. Regarding the multi-Si wafers, although the demand was showing signs of recovery, it was limited by the downstream industry chain. It was difficult to increase the wafer price as the price of the upstream polysilicon increases. The average price of the product remained stable at RMB 1.18/pc.
PV Cells
This week, the prices of mono-Si solar cells increased significantly, and the prices of G1 and M6 increased simultaneously. In the past two weeks, the demand for M6 has continued to rise. And the market price has risen to RMB 0.81-0.87/W. And the average price has risen to RMB 0.82/W. The average price of G1 mono-Si cells has also increased to RMB 0.82 /W, but the increase was not as large as that of M6 cells. The main reason was that the downstream module segment had significantly increased demand for high-efficiency mono-Si wafers. Currently, M6 products were already the hottest-selling products in the peak season. Modules with M6 cells accounted for a rising proportion of the auction projects in the Chinese market, which has become a mainstream trend.
Additionally, the modules with 180-210mm cells entered the production stage one after another in the third quarter. And the supply speed of large-size cell products was accelerated. Coupled with demand from the projects in the end market, the demand for large-size cells will be driven higher.
Modules
The prices of some modules continued to fall this week, but the overall decline has narrowed. Regarding the market for complementary materials of modules, the demand for photovoltaic glass, especially for the subsequent thin-film products, has increased to some extent, on account of the promotion of bifacial products of leading companies and the impact of the increased demand for bifacial products in all the regional markets. Some suppliers have raised their quoted prices for 2.0mm glass, while manufacturing capacity of the leading encapsulant manufacturers was also approaching its limit. It is estimated that the price will start to rise, after the inventory of module manufacturers is basically cleared out.
Judging from the recent auction projects in the Chinese market, high-efficiency mono-Si modules were still the most favored, especially M6 high-efficiency modules, accounting for nearly 40% of the total. Judging from this market share, the price stability of mono-Si modules has increased. As the overseas market recovered, the order visibility has further increased. Most of the first-tier manufacturers have indicated that the orders in their pipelines were up to mid-August. While mono-Si modules were booming, the prices of multi-Si modules did not rise due to the recovery of the downstream market. Compared with mono-Si, the prices of multi-Si modules slightly weakened. The general multi-Si (275W-280W) modules both fell marginally to RMB 1.26-1.37/W and US$0.174/W in both Chinese and non-Chinese markets.

Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon continued to rise this week. The range of acceptable market prices has increased significantly. The supply of the polysilicon has become even tighter, on account of the on-going maintenance of 3 enterprises with a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 tons from earlier, coupled with the occurrences of industrial safety incidents in polysilicon factories in the northwest region one after another. And Xinjiang’s recurrent impact of the pandemic, which began in mid-July, has intensified the pressure on logistics.
Driven by strong downstream demand, most of the top-tier companies finalized their orders for August as early as the beginning of the month. In the face of sudden industrial safety incidents of polysilicon plants, there was no polysilicon available for sale. Second-tier manufacturers with a small number of stocks have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. They were reluctant to sell the polysilicon in their hands. They were inclined to wait and see when it comes to the market, this drove the price of mono-grade polysilicon to RMB65/KG. There were rumors in the market that the price of some mono-grade polysilicon could be sold to downstream for RMB70/KG at the moment. It is estimated that the impact of the tight supply will be reflected in the price of polysilicon in the next two weeks.
Wafers
This week, the prices of wafers were stable and slightly rising. Only a small part of the manufacturers was affected by the price increase of upstream polysilicon, and the sale prices rose accordingly. The market price range of mono-Si wafers further narrowed. The price of G1 mono-Si wafers rose to RMB2.5-2.55/pc. And the M6 price of mono-Si wafers rose to RMB2.62-2.75/pc. Due to the several occurrences of unexpected incidents in upstream polysilicon factories, the leading wafer manufacturers have stopped receiving orders from yesterday. It is estimated that, on the one hand, companies will make some preliminary preparations for the upcoming price increase in polysilicon. And on the other hand, they will temporarily not be able to take large orders.
PV Cells
This week, the cell market remained similar to last week, where the prices of G1 and M6 increased simultaneously. The demand for M6, in particular, continued to be strong. The prices increased in both the Chinese and non-Chinese markets. And the prices narrowed to RMB0.82-0.87/W and US$0.1-0.103/W. Regarding the demand for G1, the price has risen to RMB0.8-0.83/W. And the average price rose to RMB0.82/W. The sale prices of a small number of urgent orders were slightly higher than the mainstream price of RMB0.02/W.
Regarding the multi-Si products, the market remained stable due to the downward spiral of the module prices. The market demand was not as strong as the optimistic prediction. As the quoted prices of the downstream modules continued to slide, cell prices remained under pressure. Some small and medium-sized companies began to consider suspending or shutting down the operations and dumping the products in the market, which will have a certain impact on market quoted prices.
Modules
This week, the module market remained similar to last week. And the overall price dropped slightly, but the narrowing decline became more obvious. The orders were still concentrated in top-tier manufacturers. The demand for mono-Si high-efficiency modules continued. In the recent tenders of the state-owned enterprises, the module price of the successful bids has rebounded from the previous round. The average price of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si (>325W/385W) modules remained at RMB1.54/W, and the price range narrowed to RMB1.45-1.57/W at the moment. Regarding multi-Si modules, under the prospect of poor demand and the extension of India’s safeguard duty, an element of uncertainty existed in multi-Si demand. And the resistance to price recovery still persisted. And the average module price slowly fell to RMB1.33/W.
However, on account of the incidents of upstream polysilicon plants, first-line companies have been slow in taking their orders. They were temporarily unable to receive large orders, mainly because the raw materials were lacking. It is estimated that the price of modules will increase incrementally in the future. Meanwhile, the volatility of the pandemic in India, the United States, and Brazil continued. The subsequent development trends of the pandemic in the non-Chinese markets still need to be closely monitored.

                                Global Trend: Modules Remain Constant Amidst Price Increase from all Sectors as Supply Chain Enters Bargaining Phase                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200730-18920.html,"


Polysilicon
The quotations in the polysilicon market this week are continuously elevating as anticipated, with the current closing price for the overall monograde polysilicon increasing to RMB$68-70/kg, and the quotation for polysilicon in the overseas market has also been simultaneously elevated to US$7.7-8.2/kg, where the high point for the global polysilicon quotation can reach to US$9.486/kg.
It is once again the time for various manufacturers to negotiate orders in August as we approach the end of July. As the overall supply in the market has become tight, the bargaining powers of the downstream wafer manufacturers have weakened despite their willingness to reduce prices. The possible material shortage for polysilicon plants have also caused several manufacturers to switch to the model of one order finalization per 1 or 2 weeks from the initial monthly finalization due to the rapid price inflation in polysilicon recently and the substantial market changes. Looking into the polysilicon market trend in August, the shortage in polysilicon will persist, and the closing prices for monograde polysilicon are expected to rise continuously.
Wafers
The wafer prices for this week are generally on an ascending trend, with an increase of roughly RMB$0.03-0.1/pc. The price for G1 mono-Si wafer has been escalated to US$2.55-2.65/pc, whereas the M6 mono-Si wafer has sustained a more apparent increase to US$2.7-2.82/pc.
An inflation pattern has started in the mono-Si wafer market under the direct impact from the increased downstream demand and the price surge from polysilicon manufacturers. After first-tier wafer manufacturers implemented a price increase last week, the cost pressure from the shortage and price increase of polysilicon has been extended to the downstream market incessantly, and enterprises that happened to be in the midst of negotiation for orders in August have also increased their prices in succession. However, the trend in deal conclusion this week has not been as bright as anticipated; although the first-tier enterprises have already shipped out their orders, the remaining enterprises are still stuck in the price negotiation and bargaining phase.
PV Cells
The prices for mono-Si PV cells have increased evidently this week, especially with high-efficiency cells, where the ASP of G1 and M6 mono-Si cells have surged to US$0.85/W and US$0.87/W respectively. Multi-Si cells have also slightly escalated accordingly with a rise of ASP at US$0.54/W.
The price increase subsequent to the announcement of the list prices for August from first-tier cell manufacturers may reflect cell enterprises’ anticipation in a continuous upstream shortage down the road, and the comprehensive upward adjustments in cell prices, implemented successively from the remaining small and medium-sized enterprises, will introduce substantial pressure to non-integrated manufacturers and the provision of N-type products that come with relatively higher cost.
Modules
The module prices for this week have been extensively stabilized in both domestic and overseas markets. Although a small number of enterprises have attempted to adjust the quotations in order to respond to the cost elevation, the downstream end market has not accepted such adjustment, which resulted in this week’s prices in concluded orders being generally constant to that of last week, where the >325W/>385W modules remain at US$1.45-1.57/W. The subsequent pricing developments in the upstream and downstream segments will become clearer next week.
At the present stage, the auxiliary products required by modules in the existing phase are also experiencing tight supply and price inflation, and enterprises may first fulfil market orders with stronger profitability. However, looking at the current overseas markets, the US market is sustaining the most severe impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and countries in Latin America, including Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, are experiencing continuous spreading of the coronavirus. Asian countries such as India, Japan, Philippines, and Indonesia are also seeing escalated cases. Thus, the second wave of outbreak may continue to paralyze the full recovery of the end market.
Note: the domestic and overseas quotations for the 305W~310W modules will be suspended starting this week in accordance with the changes of market demand.

The current average prices of mono polysilicon and multi polysilicon have elevated to RMB55/kg and RMB83/kg respectively, whereas the polysilicon prices from the overseas markets have escalated to US$8.2-9/kg, and the global polysilicon quotation has exceeded US$10/kg.  
The primary factor behind the surge in polysilicon prices this week came from the overhaul currently implemented by a number of polysilicon manufacturers. Thus, most wafer manufacturers will continue to release new production capacity during 2H20 under the polysilicon provision that is already slightly tense, in order to assist the pandemic-ravaged Xinjiang. Re-inspection of businesses, restricted logistics and transportations, and the excess demand market status, have all contributed to the significant increase of polysilicon prices, and it is anticipated that the prices for the subsequent market will continue to ascend.
Wafer
Both mono-Si wafer and multi-Si wafer increased in prices amidst the continuous  price elevation this week. The top-tier wafer manufacturer has increased the wafer  quotations for two consecutive weeks recently, which reflected directly the tension of  polysilicon provision in the market and the cost increment in wafers. The price for  mono-Si wafer that is smaller than M6 has arrived at RMB2.85/pc, whereas the price for M6 mono-Si wafer has increased to RMB2.93-3.03/pc.
The overall prosperity in the supply chain market has propelled the inflation intensity of the general prices, and the downstream industry chain is currently in the midst of active stocking while rising product prices in order to achieve cost control, which has resulted in a progressive depletion of wafer inventory that led to a slightly aggravated tension in the supply of mono-Si wafers. As for multi-Si wafers, despite the insignificant increase in the demand from downstream markets, the prices for multi-Si wafers have been invigorated by the cost impact from upstream polysilicon, and arrive at RMB1.41/pc for the average price.
Cells
The small escalation of cell prices this week is predominately seen on high-efficiency mono-Si cells, where both G1 and M6 mono-Si cells have risen to RMB0.84-0.91/W and RMB0.85-0.93/W respectively, and the average price has been contracted to RMB 0.01.
Various product categories among the central module purchasing from the success bids opened by the Chinese market have experienced an increase of RMB0.15-0.2/W compared to the previous period. Retrospecting to the cell sector, integrated manufacturers have been stocking to provide autonomous downstream usage subsequently in the hope of controlling the cost. The comprehensive increase in the quotations for upstream polysilicon and wafer has facilitated the increase in silver prices, and further adjusted the prices of cells. Despite the unwillingness from downstream module makers, most completed orders have come from first-tier manufacturers.
Modules
The marginal increases in module prices this week are seen mostly on mono-Si products, and the price differences between high-efficiency modules are expanding continuously, where the domestic and overseas prices for the >325W/>385W modules have arrived at RMB1.48-1.62/W and US$0.189-0.31/W.
The apparent recovery in the full upstream quotations has resulted in the overall price inflation in the overall auxiliary products, and module manufacturers are also in the midst of getting ready to increase the prices, though most successful transactions remain on high-efficiency modules, where a number of manufacturers are considering to postpone the purchases of raw materials such as modules due to the elevated prices. It is within anticipation that this wave of inflation will continue all the way until after the SNEC, where the prices will once again stabilize subsequent to the adequate exchange of information between buyers and sellers, and the confirmation on the demand from various companies.
Pertaining to overseas markets, 3Q20 is a traditional off period for European and American countries, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2Q20 had deferred the schedule of installations. As the demand gradually recovers after the resumption of work and production from various countries, a number of projects initially set in 2Q20 have been delayed to 3Q20, and taking into account the existing changes in the domestic supply chain, it is forecasted that overseas delivery may experience partial postponement, which may perhaps decelerate the recovery of market demand.

                                Global Trend: Module Quoted Prices Rise in Non-Chinese Markets While All Segments of the Industry Chain in Negotiation                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200813-19219.html,"


Polysilicon
The price of polysilicon continued to rise this week, and the market remained on an upward trajectory. Impacted by the insufficient supply of polysilicon in the market, the polysilicon companies that were still in production have raised their prices one after another. The overall price increase in the past two weeks has exceeded 15% on average. The sale price of mono-grade polysilicon, in particular, has increased by more than 10% on average. And the quoted prices have increased to RMB80-95/W. However, not many orders involving mono-grade polysilicon were signed this week, as most orders were finalized as early as the beginning of the month.
Observing the subsequent price trend of polysilicon, it is expected that the businesses would resume their operation in October, given that there are still four manufacturers carrying out maintenance, which are concentrated in Xinjiang. And the relief policies for the resumption of production and operation as well as the logistics and transportation were introduced one after another. What is certain is that the supply of polysilicon will remain on the low side this month. And in the downstream wafer segment, more manufacturing capacity continues to become available. The increased demand provides enough thrust to propel the polysilicon prices upward.
Wafers
The price of wafers continued to rise this week, but the overall quoted prices showed a slightly mixed trend. The quoted prices of upstream polysilicon continued to rise, whereas the end-market demand has not picked up significantly. Cells and modules continue to be under pressure as a result. The leading wafer manufacturer announced that it will adjust its prices according to the changes in the quoted prices of upstream polysilicon, and the overall prices in the wafer segment have indeed been rising to a certain extent. However, the 1st- and 2nd-tier businesses have different levels of bargaining power. Therefore the extent of increase varies. The overall volume of sales this week was on the small side. Before the prices have stabilized in the industry chain, a wait-and-see sentiment is taking hold of the markets. Consequently, the price of G1 mono-Si wafers rose slightly to RMB2.83-2.95/Pc this week. And the average price of M6 mono-Si wafers rose to RMB3.03/Pc, pushing the price difference between G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers to RMB 0.13.
PV Cells
This week, cell prices continued to rise, especially the mono-Si products. The first-tier cell manufacturer increased the cell prices after SNEC took place. The extent of increase was as high as 9%. Most mono-Si cell businesses also followed up with the increase. However, the actual sale prices remained much the same as before. This week, the price of G1 mono-Si cells remained stable at RMB0.88-0.97/W. And the price of M6 mono-Si cells slightly increased to RMB0.89-0.97/W.
With the gradual lift of the shutdown in the overseas markets, the demand for multi-Si cells has been guaranteed to a certain extent. The overall sale prices still rose slightly this week. The average price of multi-Si cells rose to RMB0.55/W and US$0.089/W in the Chinese and non-Chinese markets, respectively. Observing the subsequent trend of multi-Si products, there is no obvious factor to maintain the momentum. The overall multi-Si market is still not robust enough. And the demand may be lowered again.
Modules
The module segment continued to be under pressure this week. Some module manufacturers increased their prices on the grounds of cost increases. However, the overall transaction volume was relatively small this week. First-tier businesses or vertically integrated manufacturers still have bargaining power, and the module prices rose slightly. The second- and third-tier companies have also increased their prices due to changes in the costs. However, the end market, which was under pressure from grid connection deadlines and price increases, has stopped the procurement. In the face of dilemma, a small number of module manufacturers considered reducing the operating rate to respond to market changes.
Regarding the overseas markets, Spain bounced back significantly from the pandemic, whereas India and Brazil continued its downward spiral. It is expected that it will take time for the overall market to fully recover. The overall module prices have stopped the plunge and rebounded in the non-Chinese markets this week. The prices of most products have slightly increased by US$0.01~0.015/W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si (325W-330W (72P)) has reached US$0.19-0.23/W. The price of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si (>325W/385W) modules has increased to US$0.204-0.325/W.

Polysilicon 
The prices of polysilicon continue to elevate this week due to unstableness. Looking at the current severe shortage in the supply of polysilicon, there are 4 manufacturers in Xinjiang, the primary area for polysilicon provision, that are currently in the midst of overhaul subsequent to the work incident at the Xinjiang factory of GCL, which affected half of the polysilicon output in the area. On the other hand, the suspended operation from polysilicon factories in Sichuan due to the flooding has further exacerbated the existing polysilicon shortage and the tight supply status, and propelled the polysilicon prices to continue to rise this week, where the market price for mono polysilicon has been adjusted upward to RMB 90-98/kg, and the average global polysilicon price has exceeded US$11/kg, which has arrived at the same level of 2018.
Wafers
A continuously ascending slope can be seen from the prices of the wafer market this week. The incessant increase in upstream polysilicon prices continues to elevate the cost of wafer, where the relentless protests on the market, and that most downstream cell manufacturers are unable to sustain the ceaseless price increase from upstream due to insufficient demand by the downstream end market, have not prevented wafer businesses from increasing the prices simultaneously, who also commented that the quotations for wafer will rise alongside the perpetually inflated polysilicon prices. The price for multi-Si wafer has been elevated to RMB 1.52-1.65/pc, and the price difference between G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers continues to expand, with upward adjustments in the average price to RMB 3/pc and RMB 3.2/pc respectively.
Cells
The cell prices in the market experienced a mere fluctuation this week, and the main market is currently sitting on a bargaining phase. Upstream wafers are continuously rising in prices, with a majority of successful transactions; in contrast, despite the willingness in price increase from cell manufacturers, the transactions of cells have been arduous primarily due to the strong sentiment in the wait-and-see attitude from the downstream market, which results in the drastic depletion in purchase willingness for the downstream market, leading to uncompleted transactions. In addition, most orders from the market are derived from first-tier businesses that possess a certain degree of negotiation capability, and that most businesses sign for the orders for the specific month during the beginning of the month, thus there have been relatively less completed orders in the market this week, where the price difference between G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers remains at RMB 0.05/W.
The price of multi-Si cell is maintained at RMB 0.55/W this week, where the overseas price had been adjusted downward to US$0.084-0.089/W. According to the feedback from partial manufacturers, the price-performance ratio of multi-Si products is exhibiting a substantial surge with the persistent inflation of mono-Si products, which contributed to the recovery in the demand for multi-Si cells within the domestic market, though the intensity from the end demand will not be sufficient enough to support large-scale production capacity in the long run.
Modules
The quotations for modules have been slightly cluttered this week due to the more apparent differentiation in domestic and overseas market status. Under the incessant inflation of upstream cost, the module sector continues to sustain the price pressure from elevated cost of raw materials, and the overseas market has a higher acceptance for inflated module prices than the domestic market. Looking at the recent status on grid-connection for the overseas markets, the installation progress has been satisfactory in the markets of Germany, Poland, and Brazil, despite the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recovery in the markets around the world may carry on invigorating photovoltaic demand.
For the domestic market, a number of downstream projects have entered the delivery period, though the contradiction between supply and demand persists in the market. The end demand in the current phase has gradually lowered the purchase intensity, and most system integrators are unpleased with the suspended shipment from module makers under signed contracts, as well as the fishing in troubled waters behavior, resulting in a stalemate for the market status. The prices from the module market have slightly increased, where the >325W/>385W modules have arrived at RMB 1.53-1.65/W.

                                Global Trend: Material Shortage May Alleviate in September as Inflation Gradually Stabilizes in Supply Chain                            ",https://www.energytrend.com/pricequotes/20200827-19273.html,"


Polysilicon
The prices of polysilicon continue to elevate this week, and have once again climbed to new heights as we approach the end of the month, where the price of mono polysilicon has been adjusted upward to RMB 92-102/kg, with an average price of RMB 100/kg, whereas the average price of multi polysilicon has exceeded RMB 70/kg, with the price range reaching RMB 65-72/kg. The primary factor for the price increase remains identical to that of last several weeks, where a number of polysilicon businesses have suspended on production that led to an excess demand in the provision of polysilicon, though the inflation in the polysilicon market is expected to gradually diminish after this week.
The polysilicon businesses in Xinjiang are steadily resuming production, and the progressive recovery in supply will gradually alleviate on the shortage. Simultaneously, the acceptance in the continuous severe inflation of polysilicon for downstream businesses is on a downward slope, and these various factors have resulted in the moderate contraction for the price increase of the polysilicon market amidst the inflating trend. Certain Xinjiang polysilicon manufacturers have also pointed out that the traffic control from the logistics end has affected the timeliness of freight, which induced an increase in the transportation cost, though the supply of polysilicon has been steadily recovered, and the material shortage may be further alleviated in September.
Wafers
The transaction prices in the wafer market are stabilizing this week. First-tier wafer manufacturers had adjusted the quotations for September at the end of the month, which is merely implemented to reflect the increased exchange rate in accordance with the overseas prices, and the overall domestic quotations remain unchanged. The domestic prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers remain at RMB 2.95-3.1/pc and RMB 3.1-3.25/pc respectively, and the average price is maintained at RMB 0.2/pc.
As the end of the month is near, most businesses have begun negotiating for the orders next month, though the substantial fluctuation in the market due to the continuous increase in domestic wafer prices, along with the insufficient purchase intensity from downstream sectors, have manifested an apparent trend in suppressed cell prices, and the strong sentiment in the wait-and-see attitude persists in the market.
Cells 
The cell prices experienced a slight turmoil this week, which is particularly seen on mono-si cells. The suppression on cells is most severe due to the incessant inflation of upstream wafers, and the inability of inflation from downstream modules. Regarding mono-Si cells, the G1 mono-Si cell has arrived at the same price as G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers, with the average price reaching RMB 0.930/W. As the end of the month approaches, manufacturers have begun negotiating for the orders of September, and a number of module makers have commented on how the purchase price of cells are significantly lower than the quotations, where a price squeeze is especially severe from second and third-tier manufacturers. In contrast, the elevation in the cost of modules has prompted the market to begin shifting the focus to multi-Si cells, which provided a stable support in the demand for the specific product.
Modules
Module prices are predominantly stabilized this week. The constantly elevated prices that lasted several weeks in the overall industry chain cannot be transferred to downstream modules, and the main reason is that project purchasers from the downstream end market are unwilling to proceed with transactions, who would rather suspend on projects and delay grid construction, than purchase modules with higher prices. A number of module makers have decided to reduce production instead of fishing in troubled waters in order to maintain a friendly relationship with system integrators. The continuous seesaw battle in the market has resulted in the overall prices of the >325W/>385W modules being maintained at RMB 1.53-1.65/W, and an average price of RMB 1.56/W.
Pertaining to the overseas markets, although the prices are being maintained at US$0.202-0.325/W due to the bottleneck from the domestic supply chain, the differentiated status of the COVID-19 pandemic is noticeable. Unlike the US and Brazil, where the pressure is marginally alleviated, India has continued to experience elevation in diagnosed cases. Countries such as Spain, Japan, and Korea, likewise, are seeing a bounce back in diagnosed cases. This has led to an expansion in restrictive measures for partial countries, which may induce fluctuations in the photovoltaic market in the short term.

Polysilicon
The overall inflation in the polysilicon market has diminished this week, with merely a slight increase in the price of mono polysilicon that has been propelled to RMB 95-105/kg, with an average price of RMB 101/kg. Most polysilicon manufacturers had signed for the orders of September last week in succession, and large transactions remain stable. The resumption of production from overhaul businesses as the previous work incident from the polysilicon factory in Xinjiang alleviates has marginally mitigated the shortage of polysilicon.
As indicated by the information released by polysilicon businesses recently, the sluggish demand in 1H20 had resulted in a substantial reduction in polysilicon prices and the constant accumulation of inventory. The certain degree of differences in cost control for polysilicon businesses that are currently in production, and the decision from partial businesses in implementing early overhaul after taking into account the anticipated demand, have provided guarantees for the provision of polysilicon at full capacity in the current phase. A number of businesses will arrange adequate overhaul and transformation of certain production lines in order to optimize cost to RMB 45K/ton. In addition, the weakened demand exhibited from end purchases recently, and the apparent price squeeze tendency, as well as the production capacity from Xinjiang and Sichuan that is unable to temporarily return to the normal level in September, have contributed to the overall shortage of polysilicon in the short term, providing support for price negotiations of polysilicon.
Wafer
The prices of wafers are predominantly stable this week, and the pressure in the market persists under the impact from the impeded supply of polysilicon. Wafer businesses began initiating the pattern of “purchase frenzy” subsequent to the further contracted supply of upstream polysilicon, and started to sign for long-term orders successively in order to ensure product supply. Entering September, first-tier wafer businesses are signing successive orders, though the fluctuation of polysilicon prices has impacted partial businesses, which resulted in relatively scattered orders and greater span in the closing prices. The current closing prices for mono-Si wafers remain robust, where the average prices for mainstream products G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers are maintained at RMB 3/pc and RMB 3.2/pc respectively. However, the strict control on transportation due to the unrecovered pandemic status in Xinjiang will create a certain hindrance to the supply of wafers.
For the market of multi-Si wafers, the price advantages of the product has yet to substantially elevate downstream demand as a result of upstream inflation. The current mainstream closing price is at approximately RMB 1.6/pc for the multi-Si wafer market, with the average price maintained at RMB 1.55, where the closing prices for partial second and third-tier businesses have fallen on RMB 1.54-1.58/pc, and the concatenated inflation of upstream multi polysilicon has induced further pressure for multi-Si wafers, which generates greater pressure for business operation.
Cells
The cell market started to experience weakened prices this week, which led to stagnancy in transactions. An observation on the price trend for mono-Si cells this week has revealed a simultaneous reduction for both G1 and M6 mono-Si cells, and the difference in the average prices of the products has been expanded to RMB 0.02/W. However, the majority of the existing demand for domestic and overseas multi-Si cells derived from postponement of downstream end projects, together with the weakened purchase demand in cells for module makers, have prompted partial second and third-tier businesses to attempt to maintain the operating rate by obtaining orders through price reduction, thus leading to a relatively sluggish trend for the overall market status.
For the market of multi-Si cells, the minor increase in the prices of multi-Si cells disclosed by first-tier cell businesses at the end of August has created support for the prices of multi-Si cells, where the prices for multi-Si cells remain sturdy at RMB 0.53-0.6/W, with an average price of RMB 0.55/W. In addition, the official commencement for the shipment of large-scale cells (e.g. M10) in small quantity by major first-tier manufacturers, as well as the M10 quotations revealed by upstream wafer end, are expected to trigger a continuously elevating demand for large-scale cells subsequently.
Modules
Module orders have exhibited apparent differentiation this week, where mono-Si PERC modules of various power rangers have been revised upward at the same time. First-tier manufacturers have been successful in increasing the quotations of modules by echoing with the inflation of auxiliary products, especially with high-efficiency modules, where the 440W+ module that is recently scheduled for delivery before mid-October lingers at around RMB 1.60-1.75/W, which somewhat elevates the overall module quotations, and propels the >325W/>385W modules to rise to RMB 1.55-1.66/W. In terms of domestic tenders, the overall status in the provision and price negotiation from module suppliers and the project end has been improved. The concentration in successful tenders from leading businesses has been expanding continuously in the GW-grade tender project opened in around August, and the discussion on the group purchase of modules between China Huadian Corporation and China Huaneng Group concluded that the successful bidder is able to integrate actual production capacity of businesses and the grid construction of projects, while also request on the confirmation of the delivery cycle of modules, which generates a certain degree of escalation in the power of discourse for price negotiation of modules.
However, the incessantly increased module cost has started to generate difficulties in operation for second and third-tier module makers, who can only reduce the operating rate to mitigate on losses since downstream system integrators would rather defer project establishment based on the wait-and-see attitude towards the market. Pertaining to the overseas markets on the contrary, most domestic businesses have placed their resources in the domestic market due to the impact from the pandemic in 1H20, and despite the inevitably repeated pandemic status indicated by the fluctuations in the 3 major markets of India, Brazil, and the US, as well as the bounce backs of diagnosed cases in Europe and partial East Asian countries, and the restrictive measures currently implemented by governments around the world, the possibility in a large-scale outbreak from countries around the world remains relatively small, where projects of ground establishment for most markets are on the verge of entering normalization, thus the global branching of module businesses is expected to accelerate once again.

Polysilicon
The overall inflation in the polysilicon market has been suspended this week, with minor fluctuations seen in the quotations of partial businesses. The mono polysilicon is currently at RMB 95-105/kg, with an average price maintained at RMB 101/kg, whereas the mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon is at RMB 65-72/kg. Looking at the structure of domestic polysilicon provision from the past 3 quarters, the domestic production volume of polysilicon in between July and August had sustained a YoY reduction, and had set a consecutively low record in annual production. The void exhibited in the supply end has resulted in constant consumption of polysilicon inventory for various businesses, leading to an aggravated status of material shortage within the short term. The polysilicon market has remained on a high price level, though the intensity in price suppression from wafer businesses has been apparent, and there have been insignificant transactions at roughly RMB 100/kg.
The propulsion from the work resumption at various polysilicon manufacturers in Xinjiang since the beginning of September has slightly mitigated the pressure from the excess demand market status. Although the prices for mono and multi polysilicon remain at a high level this week, the supply volume from domestic businesses is expected to recover to more than 30K tons per month that is on par with the domestic production volume of the same period last year, as the capacity utilization in Xinjiang elevates, which prompts a progressive increase in the supply of polysilicon. Hence, the polysilicon market is exhibiting a clear sign in price stabilization thanks to the growth in polysilicon supply, and the low willingness in the purchase volume of polysilicon recently.
Wafer
The prices of wafers remain stable this week, and the overall market pressure has been relatively mitigated. Subsequent to the continuous bargaining between the wafer sector and up/downstream that lasted from late August to early September, the orders for the wafer market have been signed successively this week, where both the domestic and overseas wafer prices remain stable. Pertaining to mono-Si wafers, the transactions in first-tier businesses are relatively more unimpeded, whereas the closing prices for second and third-tier businesses are dependent on the order status, with larger interval exhibited in the overall closing price, where G1 mono-Si wafer sits at RMB 2.95-3.1/pc, and an average price of RMB 3/pc. The constant downstream demand for M6 mono-Si wafers and larger product sizes has resulted in the average domestic and overseas prices for M6 mono-Si wafers to remain at RMB 3.2/pc and US$0.404/pc, which preserves a certain degree of bargaining power for subsequent large-scale wafers.
The overall quotation for multi-Si wafers sits firmly on RMB 1.52-1.65 this week under the impact from the gradually stabilized upstream prices, and the previous increase in the cost of raw materials for multi-Si wafer has prevented the price advantage in the specific product from substantially escalating the downstream demand. Multi-Si wafer businesses are currently attempting to obtain more market shares through low prices, whereas the purchase demand from the downstream sector is gradually shifting to the mid-to-low end efficiency segment, which actuates the closing price for the low price resources of partial multi-Si wafers to fall on RMB 1.32-1.37/pc.
Cells
Prices continue to loosen in the cell market this week, where the price of G1 mono-Si cell has once again depleted. Under the impact from the general inflation of cell prices previously, downstream businesses had reduced cell purchases in the midst of price bargaining, and leading integrated businesses have successively elevated the self-use ratio of cell products, which leads to the apparent pressure in the existing price reduction of cells, and the price differentiation in mono-Si cells. G1 cell in particular has sustained simultaneous decline in domestic and overseas quotations, with the price interval adjusted to RMB 0.85-0.91/W and US$0.13-0.138, due to the impact from excessive production capacity and high prices, as well as the overall weakened bargaining power of businesses, whereas second and third-tier businesses have experienced a more evident reduction in general, with the quotation mustered at RMB 0.85-0.87/pc. On the other hand, the continuous elevation in downstream demand for large-scale (≥166mm) products has preserved a certain extent for the overall price difference between G1 and M6 cells, which has accelerated the inventory accumulation and the declining price trend of G1 cells.
Downstream module makers’ demand for multi-Si cells is on an ascending slope, which propels the prices of multi-Si cells to maintain steadily at RMB 0.53-0.6/W, and it is expected that the quotations for multi-Si cells may remain sturdy due to the higher price-performance ratio of the product.
Modules
The overall inflation in the module market has been suspended this week, though the prices from various businesses are relatively hectic. The primary products in the current market of 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si PERC module remains at RMB 1.55-1.66/W, and the 355-365W /425-435 W mono-Si PERC module sits at RMB 1.55-1.72/W. Looking at the quotation status for various businesses, the price difference between first and second-tier modules has become evident, where the overall quotation remains constant from the centralized orders from first-tier businesses, and a number of businesses have decelerated on the installation progress in order to benefit partial end projects, for which the diminished new orders have resulted in several first-tier businesses in reducing the amount of outsourcing so as to maintain the existing operating rate. As for partial second and third-tier businesses that possess weaker bargaining power, the quotation for modules has started to loosen, and has even fallen to below RMB 1.5/W for some 325-335W modules.
In addition, as the end demand continues to pull and release, several projects remain unchanged in terms of the anticipation on grid-connection at the end of the year, and multiple end projects have restarted tenders to advance construction period, which impels an elevation in the shipment volume of partial N-type and film products. Furthermore, the glass materials required by the downstream sector have been consecutively increasing in prices recently, thus impeding the overall module status from exiting the market status of August, and the pressure for the supply from the module market persists.
Note: The adjustments on the specifications of cells and module will begin this week due to the changes in the market demand.

Polysilicon 
The prices in the overall polysilicon market this week remain stable, where the prices in the domestic polysilicon market sit firmly, and an increase has been seen in overseas quotations. As the status in the polysilicon provision gradually improves in September, the bargaining between polysilicon and downstream sectors has started to alleviate, and the price for mono polysilicon is currently at RMB 95-105/kg, with an average price of RMB 101/kg, whereas the mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon is maintained at RMB 65-72/kg. In terms of overseas prices, the fluctuation in the exchange rate has prompted the global multi polysilicon to rise to US$8.481-13.7/kg.
Looking at the supply and demand for the existing polysilicon market, downstream wafer manufacturers have successively signed for long-term orders with polysilicon businesses since the wave of inflation derived from the supply chain since August in order to ensure product provision, which has laid down a foundation for the progressively stabilized polysilicon market. The production of polysilicon in Xinjiang previously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic has resumed operation in mid-September, where both DQ and Xinte have arrived at full load, and the multi polysilicon base of Sichuan that had temporarily suspended production due to flooding is also expected to gradually recover in production capacity during October. Hence, the overall polysilicon provision remains on a climbing slope, though it has mitigated the current tight supply of polysilicon.
Wafer
The overall prices of wafers remain stable this week, and the impact from the changes to the downstream prices is gradually manifesting. Under the impact from the stabilized polysilicon quotations, the overall wafer quotations in the domestic market remain anchored this week, where the average prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers remain at RMB 3.1/pc and RMB 3.1-3.25/pc respectively. The overseas markets have sustained a slight increase in prices due to the fluctuated exchange rate, where multi-Si wafers have been revised upward to US$0.203-0.214/pc, and the average prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers have been marginally escalated, arriving at US$0.387/pc and US$0.408/pc respectively, with the price difference between the two being expanded to US$0.021/pc.
As downstream cell sectors continue to release the signal of loosening prices, the mono-Si wafer quotations from partial second and third-tier wafer businesses have exhibited a declining trend, where a number of G1 quotations have been dropped below RMB 2.95/pc, though the overall transaction volume remains on the inferior end. Simultaneously, under the impact from the incessantly unswerving upstream polysilicon prices, first-tier wafer businesses have yet to implement adjustments despite possessing pricing power, which actuates overall stable prices. With downstream leading businesses such as Longi and JA Solar successively initiating production of large-scale cell modules, the shipment intensity in large-scale wafers from mainstream wafer businesses may amplify, which is expected to continue to stabilize the prices of large-scale wafers in the short term.
Cells
The pressure in the cell market persists this week, where G1 cell has seen a small decrease in prices. After the loosened quotations for G1 mono-si cells from partial businesses last week, more businesses have lowered the prices of G1 this week, which propels the overall reduction in G1 quotations, and a number of businesses have started to experience inventory accumulation that has aggravated the subsequent depleting pressure in G1 products and prompted a simultaneously downward revision in domestic and overseas quotations for G1 mono-Si cells this week, with the overall price interval being adjusted to RMB 0.85-0.9/W and US$0.127-0.138/W respectively. 
The overall stabilized quotations for upstream and downstream multi-Si cells, as well as the insignificant fluctuation in the demand for multi-Si cells, have resulted in sturdy quotations for multi-Si cells this week at RMB 0.53-0.6/W. Looking into the subsequent market, the overall market demand for 4Q20 is optimistic, though the recovery in the overall operating rate of cells may be postponed to late September or early October due to the perpetual supply pressure from the cell market within the short term.
Modules
The elevated module cost due to the quotations for auxiliary products has prompted an increase in prices for the module market this week. The primary products in the current domestic market of 325-335W/395-405W and 355-365W /425-435W mono-Si PERC modules have been respectively elevated to RMB 1.6/W and RMB 1.62/W respectively in average prices. However, due to the continuously loosening upstream cell quotations, the end market persists in applying pressure when purchasing modules, thus the upstream and downstream sectors are tangled up in the bargaining phase with each order having its own price, and the actual closing prices for a majority of module businesses have not been evidently fluctuated. Regarding the status of grid-connection in the market, the average of household installation was at roughly 1GW between July and August, with accumulation of deferred grid-connection and UHV projects from 1H20, indicating an optimistic market demand for 3Q20. In addition, the previously impeded supply of modules has led to the ability in module shipment in batches for domestic downstream projects, and the domestic market is expected to initiate another wave of congregated photovoltaic projects and grid-connection in October prior to the holiday.
The overseas markets are seeing a continuous ascension in the quotations and successive conclusion for a small amount of module spots, among which, the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si PERC module has been increased to US$0.208-0.326/W, and the 355-365W /425-435W mono-Si PERC module has arrived at US$0.232-0.364/W. The second outbreak of the pandemic in primary markets of the US, Europe, Japan, and Korea has not subverted the recovering trend in the overall photovoltaic demand. On the contrary, the Indian market is sustaining the largest degree of pressure, where the progress in the implementation of photovoltaic projects has been substantially hindered this year, with less than 2GW of installed capacity during 1H20. The dynamic in inventory pull for the specific local market remains diminutive, though the overall impact from the pandemic is gradually mitigated, which leads to a marginal recovery in the demand for multi-Si modules, and propels the overseas price of 275-280 / 330-335W multi-Si module to climb back to US$0.19-0.31/W.

Polysilicon
The loosened quotations caused by the small amount of new orders in the polysilicon market this week have propelled a small reduction in both mono and multi polysilicon. As the National Day of the PRC approaches, polysilicon businesses are starting to implement procurements successively according to various demand, and among the new orders that are currently in negotiation, the quotations from first-tier polysilicon businesses are generally stable, whereas the quotations from second and third-tier polysilicon businesses are preserving a certain degree of bargaining room. The insignificant number of completed orders in high price polysilicon previously has resulted in accumulated inventory for partial second and third-tier polysilicon businesses, and the simultaneous impact from the price suppression of downstream sectors as well as the minor decrease of new order prices, have actuated the mainstream quotation for mono polysilicon to drop to RMB 95-103/kg, with an average price of RMB 99/kg. The mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon is at roughly RMB 65-71/kg, and the average price has been reduced to RMB 68/kg, whereas the global average price for polysilicon has been lowered to US$12.091/kg.
Looking at the overall supply and demand of the polysilicon market, the supply volume of the market is recovering gradually, and the minor overhaul implemented by sporadic number of businesses among the 11 local polysilicon businesses has created insignificant impact to the production capacity. The void of polysilicon provision is centralized on 3 first-tier businesses, among which the two businesses in Xinjiang have yet to reach to full load, and the single business in Sichuan has yet to resume production, with the rest of the businesses operating at full load. Under the undersupply status of the overall polysilicon market in September, wafer businesses had less actual orders in the face of a polysilicon price that remains at about RMB 100/kg, and a number of businesses have reduced the operating rate and suppressed on prices, thus the bargaining between upstream and downstream sectors continues. As downstream first-tier businesses stock up successively for the National Day Holiday and the subsequent market, the polysilicon market is expected to witness improvement in prices by the end of the month.
Wafer 
The overall wafer market remains stable this week, where the wiggle room for partial businesses in new orders has been expanded. The prices of mono-Si wafers remain robust, where the price of G1 wafer remains at RMB 2.95-3.1/pc, and the price of M6 wafer remains at RMB 3.1-3.25/pc, whereas the difference between the average prices of G1 and M6 is maintained at RMB 0.2/pc. Continuing from the trend of last week, the mainstream quotation for multi-Si wafers sits at RMB 1.52-1.65/pc, and the overall quotation remains stable from the ordinary market demand.
Most first-tier businesses are currently in the presentation phase, and remain generally stable in new requests for quotation. However, small and medium-sized businesses, under the impact from the loosened downstream quotations, have clearly indicated the possibility in negotiation despite the stabilize quotations when asked for new requests, with the fluctuation of wafer quotations remained predominantly at RMB 0.02-0.03/pc.
Cells
The overall quotations of cells are currently stable, with merely a small amount of orders seeing price fluctuations. G1 and M6 quotations remain robust this week, where the price interval for G1 cell remains at RMB 0.85-0.9/W, and the price of G1 bifacial cell has been stabilized at RMB 0.85-0.93/W. The production capacity of M6 in the overall market right now is evidently smaller than that of G1, and the gradual transition to M6 cells from downstream demand has provided a certain level of subsequent support for M6 cells. Pertaining to multi-Si cells, the restricted space in reduction, along with the few businesses that possess a strong purchase willingness, have led to a generally stable quotation, apart from the signs of loosening in the orders from a small batch of second and third-tier businesses. The quotation remains stable at RMB 0.53-0.6/W this week.
An observation on the current status in order signing for cell businesses in general has revealed that the reduction in cell quotations from two weeks ago has failed to elevate the transaction volume of the market. Existing first-tier businesses with pricing power are no longer lowering prices, and the downstream market is adhering to a wait-and-see attitude, thus the bargaining will persist in the cell market within the short term, and the actual transaction status may gradually alleviate starting from next week.
Modules
The overall module prices have slightly decreased this week, with differentiation seen in the quotations from first and second-tier module businesses. Subsequent to the bargaining between the module sector and end purchasers, the bid prices for a number of projects have been marginally escalated compared to before, and the overall module quotations no longer ascend, where the price of the 325-335/395-405W mono-Si PERC module has been lowered to RMB 1.54-1.62/W, and the 355-365/425-435W mono-Si PERC that is experiencing relatively well demand has been reduced to RMB 1.58-1.7/W, with the difference between the average prices of the two products being enlarged to RMB 0.04/W. On the other hand, the suspension and postponement in partial local end projects persists, and the urgent demand in modules recently has been focused on the ＞410W products, which are required to ship in batches between September and October, thus leading to an overall stable quotation for most of the existing first-tier businesses. On the contrary, the quotations from second and third-tier module businesses have experienced a fallback tendency due to factors such as inventory and scale, and the closing price for partial mono-Si modules is at RMB 1.55-1.58/W.
The overall weak demand for multi-Si modules is merely invigorated by the demand from local directional tenders and the weak-and-semi-strong efficiency market, and the fluctuation in the exchange rate has prompted the domestic and overseas pries of the 275-280w/330-335W multi-Si module to drop to RMB 1.3-1.38/W and US$0.18-0.31/W.

Note: The photovoltaic price trend of EnergyTrend will be suspended for one week (October 5th) during the holiday of Mid-Autumn and National Day.
Polysilicon
The polysilicon market continues the trend from last week, where the decline of partial closing prices has actuated a minor adjustment in the overall polysilicon prices. As the National Day of the PRC approaches, downstream wafer businesses have begun the procurement of polysilicon successively for stocking purposes after the holiday. Looking at the current negotiation of orders, the overall price trend is relatively stagnant, where the downstream sector wishes to continue to suppress on the prices due to comparatively well demand, and most businesses are adhering to a wait-and-see attitude. The supply volume of the current polysilicon market is on an ascending phase, and a number of polysilicon businesses are becoming less willing in maintaining the same quotations, who are compromising on a certain degree in prices in order to obtain the orders in October, which propels the continuous depletion in polysilicon quotations. The mainstream quotation for mono polysilicon has been dropped to RMB 93-98/kg this week, with the average price lowered to RMB 95/kg, whereas the mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon has arrived at roughly RMB 63-68/kg, and an average price that has been declined to RMB 65/kg.
Looking at the supply status for the polysilicon market during September, the supply volume of polysilicon businesses has been progressively elevating, and the domestic production volume of polysilicon has reached to 32K tons, which is a MoM improvement of roughly 20%. 8 domestic polysilicon businesses, including Daqo, Xinte, and Asia Silicon, have been operating in full load as of this week, and the void in the production capacity from Xinjiang between July and August has been substantially repaired. The assist from the provision of polysilicon businesses outside of Shanghai, along with the further release of supply volume from Yongxiang, East Hope, and GCL-Poly that is expected to occur in October, will stabilize the demand and supply status. The prices of polysilicon are not expected to sustain a major fluctuation within the short term, and the trend of market prices will depend on the bargaining progress between leading polysilicon and wafer businesses.
Wafer
The demand and supply remains stable for the wafer market this week, with merely a minor escalation in the quotation for G1. Major supplier Longi has revealed the quotations of mono-Si wafers for October, with minor increase in overseas prices in accordance with the exchange rate, and the overall domestic quotations for wafers remain unchanged, where the collaborative amplification in the active stocking strategy for downstream clients prior to the National Day has also helped with the robustness of wafer prices. Simultaneously, the synergistic effort in the reinforcement of wafer supply and demand for Longi and Tongwei continues to contribute to the expansion in the production capacity of polysilicon, and the two businesses hope to establish a formidable collaboration of complementary advantages from polysilicon to modules
Pertaining to wafer prices, as the downstream sector continues to elevate the procurement demand for M6 mono-Si wafers, a number of wafer businesses have been gradually shifting the production capacity of G1 wafer to M6, which results in an overall stable demand and supply of G1, and a marginal price increase to RMB 3-3.1/pc. Regarding M6, the overall closing price in the market has a larger span at RMB 3-3.3/W, and an average price of RMB 3.2/W. The recent stabilization in polysilicon, and the impact of upstream polysilicon cost on wafers, have provided a certain level of support for the quotations for multi-Si wafers, and the demand is centralized on medium-efficiency wafers, high-efficiency wafers, and black silicon, with the overseas and domestic average prices arriving at RMB 1.55/W and US$0.211/W respectively.
Cells
The quotations for cells are fundamentally stabilized this week as the demand improves in October. The gradual alleviation in the price pressure for upstream raw materials and silver paste, together with the invigorated demand for high-efficiency modules, have provided a support for the overall cell prices. In addition, the downstream demand is steadily shifting to M6 cells, though the overall production capacity of M6 in the market is substantially smaller than that of G1, and that the supply for the former has yet to fully release, thus the supply of M6 mono-Si cells is expected to remain relatively tight in 4Q20 under flourishing demand.
The fluctuations for the prices of various cells have decelerated this week. Regarding mono-Si cells, the market demand for mono-Si M6 has evidently increased, which leads to a continuously resilient quotation for M6, with the closing price this week congregated at RMB 0.92-0.95/W. The demand for G1 cell has been declining moderately, with the price of single-sided cells remained stable temporarily, whereas the quotation interval for bifacial G1 cells has been enlarged to RMB 0.83-0.91/W. The demand for multi-Si cells has been relatively sluggish recently, though the quotations no longer have wiggle room due to the restriction derived from the cost, and will continue to be stable within the short term with a price interval remained at RMB 0.53-0.6/W.
Modules
The quotations for high-efficiency modules remain sturdy this week, with apparent differentiation between the quotation trends of first and second-tier businesses. The high-efficiency 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module has seen relatively well demand this week, with more concentrated orders from first-tier businesses, which prompts the price interval to be stabilized at RMB 1.58-1.7/W, whereas the weaker ability in obtaining orders for second and third-tier module businesses has led to signs of loosened module quotations, and the quotation for partial 325-335W module has diminished to RMB 1.52/W. On the other hand, the recent tender market has witnessed a number of bid prices at merely about RMB 1.5/W, with a relatively small transaction volume that has not created significant impact to the quotation of modules.
A resonance is expected to occur in the domestic and overseas demand during 4Q20. The overall suspension and postponement for the end demand in the country persists in 3Q20, and a number of projects have progressed in various phases, with primary support coming from projects of UHV and residential photovoltaic, thus the main drive for the domestic photovoltaic market during 4Q20 is expected to thrive on affordable and competitive projects. Looking at the overseas markets, the COVID-19 pandemic had created larger impact to photovoltaic installation in partial regions, where the development of photovoltaic had exceeded the initial anticipation for some areas. Take Germany for instance, the country had an accumulated installation of 2.4GW in 1H20, which is a YoY growth of 14%. The US and Japanese markets have a higher acceptance in price increases from the supply chain, where Vietnam had experienced a stronger demand within Southeast Asia, and the Indian market has sustained stagnancy due to the pandemic. The intensive release of advantaged photovoltaic information from the macroscopic level of US and European economies has accelerated the “green recovery”, and the end demand for photovoltaic in the US and Europe is expected to surge expeditiously in 4Q20 under mitigated pandemic status.

Polysilicon
The bargaining in the polysilicon market persists this week, and the overall closing prices continue to decline marginally. Among which, the mainstream quotation for mono polysilicon is at RMB 92-97/kg, with the average price lowered to RMB 94/kg, whereas the price of multi polysilicon is relatively maintained at an average price of RMB 65/kg. The impact of the exchange rate has slightly propelled the average price of multi polysilicon in non-China regions to US$11.411/kg, and actuated the global average price of polysilicon to US$11.719/kg.
Among local businesses that are currently producing multi polysilicon, one of the two Xinjiang businesses that are in the midst of overhauling production lines has been gradually recovered, and another is expected to resume normal production in November. As the production capacity successively recovers in Xinjiang, the supply volume of the polysilicon market is on a progressive ascension, and the overall supply and demand of the specific market is marching steadily towards a balanced state. In addition, an additional polysilicon business has entered production suspension and overhaul in Inner Mongolia, and the production capacity from the overhaul in Sichuan is forecasted for gradual release starting from late October, with the production volume of polysilicon in the market expected to approach 35K tons during October, signaling a somewhat tight supply of polysilicon as a whole.
Wafer
The market transaction of the overall wafer market remains stable this week, with minor reduction in the prices of multi-Si wafers. The order volume of multi-Si wafers for first-tier businesses is currently optimistic, though the order demand from small and medium-sized businesses has exhibited sluggishness, especially with the sign of loosened closing prices for partial orders subsequent to the National Day of the PRC, which has triggered the quotation interval for the multi-Si wafer market to lower to RMB 1.52-1.65/pc, whereas the domestic and overseas average prices are now at RMB 1.54/pc and US$0.209/pc. Pertaining to mono-Si wafers, the market demand has been remarkable, and the overall quotations remain resilient, where the average prices for G1 and M6 are maintained at RMB 3.05/pc and 3.2/pc respectively, with a price difference lingering at RMB 0.15/pc.
The mono-Si wafer market continues the trend from last month after the National Day of the PRC, where major suppliers had signed for the order of this month in the beginning of this month, and most wafer businesses are currently in a stable delivery phase of purchase orders for upstream polysilicon despite the full load status during the long holiday. The loosened upstream and downstream quotations have applied additional pressure on the overall multi-Si wafer market, and the relaxed quotations offered by small and medium-sized businesses when faced with new requests for quotation have resulted in a minor depletion of closing prices for multi-Si wafer orders.
Cells
The overall quotations for cells sit firmly this week, where the closing prices for a small number of G1 orders have exhibited a declining trend. The significant differentiation in the current market demand for mono-Si cells has prompted the price of G1 to fall once again, whereas M6 continues to remain sturdy. The quotation interval for G1 cells is currently at RMB 0.83-0.89/W, with a mainstream market quotation at RMB 0.85/W, and the average price of M6 cell remains at RMB 0.92/W. Due to the limited degree of price declination, the average price of multi-Si cells sits stationarily at RMB 0.55/W.
Looking at the overall transaction status of cells, the demand for end projects has exhibited recovery signals as the fourth quarter befalls, and the M6 orders for October from mainstream suppliers have basically been filled due to the preference on large-scale cells from the downstream sector, with robustness seen in closing prices. On the contrary, the demand for G1 is gradually shrinking, and the price continues to fluctuate. Regarding multi-Si cells, the end demand has started to exhibit stagnancy, though the quotation is expected to remain sturdy due to limited degree of deterioration.
Modules
The quotations for modules have fluctuated marginally this week, of which the quotations for large-scale modules have returned to the rising slope. Having entered 4Q20, first-tier module makers are handling significant amount of orders, and the closing prices for partial replenished orders are RMB 0.03-0.05/W more expensive than the closing prices prior to the holiday. Second and third-tier module businesses are prone to weaker ability in obtaining orders, and that suppliers are yet to perceive an elevation in demand during 4Q20. The quotations for modules have yet to be unified due to separate negotiations for individual orders. Apart from the relatively low prices in partial tenders, the market quotations for M6 module by mainstream businesses are all above RMB 1.6/W, which has impelled the average price of the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module to slightly rise to RMB 1.61/W.
On the other hand, the restriction derived in the new production capacity of glass that began from 2H20 has elevated cost during August and September, which has created tenseness in both demand and supply, thus resulting in the incessant inflation of photovoltaic glass. The excess supply status will become the primary trend recently, and the tension emanated from the demand and supply of glass is expected to remain unalleviated until the end of this year. As the ratio of large modules of 182 and 210mm escalates, large-scale glass is forecasted to sustain a structural shortage in the future.
In terms of overseas markets, the second bounce back in the status of the COVID-19 pandemic continues in Europe, and has not substantially impacted the overall projects, whereas the partial lockdown implemented for a period of time during 3Q20 has led to a certain degree of temporal impact to a number of projects for the Spanish market. The US plans to increase the duty on photovoltaic imports in 2022, and reinitiate the taxation policy on bifacial modules that will elevate the cost of imported modules for local businesses, and a fluctuation is expected to occur in module prices between 4Q20 and 1Q21. The focus of the emerging markets remains at India, where the progress of local photovoltaic installation has decelerated due to the pandemic during 1H20. As the pandemic-induced impact mitigates on the market, and that the overall market is shifting to an improved status as the end of the year approaches, the degree of improvement in the local demand remains to be a worthy focus.

Polysilicon
The quotations in the polysilicon market continue to fluctuate this week, with a manifestation of declining pressure in the overall polysilicon prices. Domestic and overseas mono polysilicon orders are currently sustaining a reduction in prices, where the mainstream domestic quotation for mono polysilicon sits at RMB 91-95/kg, with the average price lowered to RMB 92/kg, whereas the decelerated downstream demand has resulted in the continuously decreasing trend for multi polysilicon, with the mainstream market quotation arriving at RMB 60-65/kg, and the average price reduced to RMB 63/kg. Overseas quotations have deteriorated simultaneously under the impact of the overall polysilicon price trend, which induced the global price of polysilicon to descend to US$11.476/kg.
The supply volume of the polysilicon market continues to elevate having entered late October, and 3 out of 11 domestic polysilicon businesses currently remain at the overhaul phase. The resumption of production capacity in Xinjiang and Sichuan at the end of this month is expected to alleviate the overall tight supply of polysilicon. However, the inventory level for a number of businesses in the polysilicon market has marginally increased after having gone through the previous price bargaining, which will result in a more evident price suppression from the downstream sector during procurement. Most polysilicon businesses are offering larger profits for long-term orders from regular clients through apparently loosened prices. Second and third-tier businesses have received less new requests for quotation recently, where downstream wafer businesses are primarily adhering to a wait-and-see attitude. On the whole, upstream and downstream sectors are in the midst of a noticeable bargaining stage, and the gradual elevation in polysilicon supply is forecasted to continue to lower the overall polysilicon prices.
Wafer 
The quotations for wafer have experienced a small fluctuation this week, where the prices of mono and multi-Si wafers continue to differentiate. The demand for multi-Si wafers that has turned sluggish recently has prompted the quotations for upstream multi polysilicon to continue to loosen. The quotation interval for the multi-Si wafer market this week has been lowered to RMB 1.52-1.63/pc, and the domestic and overseas average prices are now at RMB 1.53/pc and US$0.207/pc respectively.
Mono-Si wafers have been enjoying remarkable market demand, where the relevant quotations from first-tier businesses remains sturdy, with the average price of M6 maintained at RMB 3.2/pc. As the production line of G1 shifts to the production of wafers larger than 158.75mm, the overall supply volume is on a progressive diminishment, and the market demand is also exhibiting stagnancy, which has induced a simultaneous contraction in the supply and demand of the overall G1 market, and impelled the existing quotation to preside stationarily at RMB 3-3.1/pc, with the average price maintained at RMB 3.05/pc.
Cells
The overall quotations of cells continue to fluctuate this week, where the price of M6 cell remains robust. As the downstream demand gradually transitions to large-scale and high-efficiency products, weak-and-semi-strong efficiency cells are experiencing increasing pressure in shipment and cost, though the limited degree of price declination has stabilized the average price at RMB 0.55/W this week, and that the Indian market is also seemingly shifting to mono-Si wafers amidst the decelerated demand, thus the production capacity of multi-Si cells is expected to linger on the descending slope. On the contrary, the orders of ≥166mm high-efficiency mono-Si cells persist in escalation, however, the restricted market supply has provided support for the market price of M6, where the average domestic and overseas quotations have arrived at RMB 0.92/W and US$0.12/W respectively.
The overall market supply and demand of G1 mono-Si cells has gradually turned lethargic since 3Q20, and the shrinkage of provision is greater than that of demand within the short term, together with the aggressive price suppression from the downstream sector, have created a relatively chaotic situation in quotation. Although the overall average price of the G1 cell currently sits at approximately RMB 0.84/W, the incessant expansion in the quotation differences between first and second-tier businesses has resulted in a quotation as low as RMB 0.8/W from partial second and third-tier businesses that are focused on transactions in small batches. For businesses that produce G1 cells in the supply chain, the product will continue to sustain a market status of weakened demand and supply under the large-scale trend in the future after the gradual elimination of the previous excess demand bottleneck, and the large probability of the supply end is bound to continue to diminish, where the prices from first-tier businesses that possess stronger abilities in order obtainment will become a decisive element in the G1 market.
Modules
The quotations for modules remain stable this week, where the demand for high-efficiency products has slightly increased the prices of high-efficiency modules. A number of module makers are intending to adjust module quotations under the rising cost of auxiliary materials such as glass and film recently, though the end market has been reluctant in accepting such adjustment, and the bargaining between upstream and downstream sectors has become evident, where merely a small batch of urgent orders have been finalized with a closing price that is slightly higher than the market standard. On the other hand, the compelling demand for modules during 4Q20, as well as the amplification in the ratio of bifacial modules, have resulted in the severe shortage of glass. The demand for single-sided and bifacial backplane modules has been growing under the critical short supply of glass, and the shipment scale of the products has ascended evidently.
Domestic ground projects have accelerated on the construction period with the arrival of 4Q20, where tenders and household projects for 2020 have entered the final installation period, and the end domestic and overseas demand derived from the arrival of the traditional peak season in photovoltaic, prior to the winter holiday in overseas, continues to invigorate module shipment. The orders of first-tier businesses are relatively stable right now, and partial second and third-tier module makers are successively lowering the operating rate to respond to the cost pressure, which facilitates the stabilization of the overall market quotations, where the 275-280/330-335W multi-Si module sits at RMB 1.35/W, and the average price of the 325-335/395-405W mono-Si PERC module resides firmly at RMB 1.54/W. The recent quotation for the M6 module from mainstream businesses has arrived at above RMB 1.6/W, and the pries of high-efficiency modules above 440W in tender projects from the domestic market are usually bid with RMB 1.6-1.62/W, which propels the average price of the 355-365/425-435W mono-Si PERC module to rise moderately to RMB 1.62/W.

Polysilicon
The overall polysilicon market is currently on a declining trend as polysilicon prices continue to deplete this week. As the end of the month approaches, most polysilicon businesses have begun negotiating for the orders of next month as they gradually consume their inventory. According to the closing prices of the new orders that have been signed, both mono and multi polysilicon have exhibited a descending tendency. As of this week, the mainstream quotation for mono polysilicon is at RMB 88-94/kg, with the average price downward adjusted to RMB 89/kg, whereas the mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon sits at RMB 57-63/kg, with the average price also downward adjusted to RMB 60/kg. Overseas quotations for polysilicon have simultaneously recovered in the midst of the general declination of domestic polysilicon prices, where the average global price of polysilicon has been actuated to US$11.043/W. After undergoing three waves of downward price adjustments in October, the prices of mono and multi polysilicon have predominantly returned to the level of early August.
According to the production plan and the overhaul of production lines for polysilicon businesses, 2 out of 11 domestic polysilicon businesses currently remain at the overhaul phase, and the additional volume of domestic polysilicon production is primarily centralized on the released capacity of GCL-Poly and East Hope from production resumption, where the domestic production volume of polysilicon for October is expected to approach 35K tons, which is essentially constant to the average supply volume to the first quarter of 2020. In contrast to the concluded polysilicon transactions this week, the recovery of polysilicon prices is not derived from the contraction of downstream demand, but rather the gradual recuperation of polysilicon supply from partial businesses, as well as the increased inventory from a certain businesses due to the previous bargaining. As the polysilicon market continues to elevate the volume of supply, a continuously escalating provision of polysilicon is expected to be seen in October, and the overall polysilicon prices will potentially descend further.
Wafer
The quotations for wafer have been predominantly stable this week, where the overseas prices of mono and multi-Si wafers have been slightly risen. As disclosed by the quotations from leading wafer businesses at the end of the month, the domestic quotations for mono-Si wafers remain robust, and overseas quotations continue to rise in small degree, which propel the current domestic average prices for G1 and M6 to remain firmly at RMB 3.05/pc and 3.2/pc respectively, whereas the overseas quotations for G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers have been upward adjusted to US$0.399/pc and US$0.42/pc respectively. Due to the low profit for multi-Si wafer businesses, and the relatively weaker support for market demand, the domestic and overseas average prices are maintained sturdily at RMB 1.53/pc and US$0.207/pc under the previous market status of a simultaneous reduction in quantity and prices.
An observation on the current order status from the wafer market indicates that mono-Si wafer orders are still centralized on first-tier businesses, and the new orders that have been signed for next month have revealed that the closing prices for mono-Si high-efficiency wafers are more concentrated, with fewer orders concluded on high price levels. SME wafer businesses are relatively more vulnerable against the overall wafer price suppression from the downstream sector based on the reason of declining polysilicon quotations, thus they are forced to forfeit a small portion of profit. A wiggle room of RMB 0.05/pc remains for the actual closing price of the G1 mono-Si wafer market, even if the leading businesses have yet to lower the quotations for G1. Regarding multi-Si wafers, first-tier wafer businesses maintain solid quotations, whereas second and third-tier businesses have preserved a small degree of wiggle room in negotiations.
Cells
The quotations of cells have experienced minor fluctuations this week, and the price differentiation between G1 and M6 mono-Si cells has been apparent. With the successive signing of cell orders at the end of the month, the robust quotations from first-tier businesses have impelled the relatively stabilized prices of mono-Si high-efficiency cells, where only partial urgent orders have experienced an increase of roughly RMB 0.02/W. The overall demand for mono-Si cells continue to elevate in the fourth quarter, though the price difference between segmented products is gradually widening. The quotations for weak-and-semi-strong efficiency cells continue to descend, with larger intervals between closing prices. As the pressure of downward adjustments persists, the average price of G1 mono-Si cells has been depleted to RMB 0.83/W, and the figure has been further lowered to RMB 0.80-0.82/W for weaker second and third-tier businesses. The price of M6 mono-Si cells is maintained at RMB 0.9-0.97/W, with an average price of RMB 0.92/W.
The supply and demand for multi-Si cells has been relatively stabilized, with no major changes in prices, though the insignificant recovery in the demand has resulted in fewer profit degree in quotations, and the closing price is primarily at about RMB 0.55/W. A number of businesses have commented that they are considering shutting down production lines as they are yet to see an evident breaking point of demand.
Modules
The quotations for modules remain stable this week under the impact of rising prices in glass and EVA, where the average price of the 325-335 / 395-405W mono-Si PERC module sits firmly at RMB 1.54/W, and the mainstream price of the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module is at RMB 1.58-1.72/W, with an average price of RMB 1.62/W. First-tier businesses in particular are almost at the limit for the orders of November, and are experiencing unimpeded order issuances, where the quotations for partial small orders have increased, which is seen on the 425W mono-Si module with the quotation going as high as RMB 1.72/W. As for multi-Si modules, the average price of the 275-280 / 330-335W multi-Si module is at RMB 1.35/W, and apart from the predominantly constant quotations from a number of first-tier businesses, the quotations from second and third-tier module makers are unable to achieve unification, thus creating a larger quotation interval at RMB 1.3-1.38/W.
On the other hand, auxiliary materials for photovoltaic continue to increase in prices, where the latest average price for photovoltaic glass has exceeded RMB 40/㎡, and the elevated ratio in the demand for bifacial modules has aggravated the shortage of glass. The procurement of the module market on cells and auxiliary materials are negotiated based on the premise of stabilized module prices apart from M6, though partial module makers have reduced the operating rate in order to respond to the resonance in demand coming from domestic and overseas markets during the fourth quarter, the shortage in auxiliary materials, and the continuously escalated module costs. In addition, a new wave of inflation is being fermented by module makers, and the changes in module prices may be reflected in the subsequent market.

Polysilicon
The polysilion orders for this week have been successively concluded, and the overall market prices have been stabilized. According to the currently concluded polysilicon orders, there have been fewer orders closed on high price levels, and the mainstream quotation for mono polysilicon is at RMB 88-92/kg, with an average price of RMB 89/kg. The downstream market remains inferior in the purchase volume of multi polysilicon under the impact from stagnant end demand for the particular product, which resulted in the mainstream quotation of multi polysilicon to arrive at RMB 57-63/kg, and a stabilized average price of RMB 60/kg. The overall closing price of polysilicon has slightly depleted due to bargaining, and the global polysilicon price has been adjusted to US$11.096/W.
The top 4 suppliers in production volume amongst 11 domestic polysilicon businesses had produced a combined total of 25.8K tons polysilicon in October that occupy approximately 75% of the total production volume, which is expected to continue to experience a slight MoM increase in November as Xinjiang and Sichuan further release production capacity after operation resumption from overhaul. In addition, the pandemic status of the Kashgar Prefecture makes it necessary for a continuous observation on the prospect of provision from Xinjiang’s polysilicon market. In general, as the downstream sector constantly releases new production capacity of mono-Si wafers and continues to elevate the demand for polysilicon, and that the market supply of polysilicon is also further increasing at the same time, the supply and demand will enter a relatively balanced state alongside the escalated ascension in polysilicon supply and downstream market demand, and the polysilicon prices in the subsequent market will remain sluggish for the long term.
Wafer 
The difference between the quotation trends for mono and multi-Si wafers has been widened this week, and the prices for multi-Si wafers have turned sluggish. As disclosed by the quotations of leading businesses, the domestic quotations for mono-Si wafers remain sturdy, whereas the corresponding overseas quotations have slightly risen. In contrast to the continuous inflation between July and August, the domestic prices of mono-Si wafers have been stabilized for two consecutive months, where the domestic average prices for G1 and M6 are maintained at RMB 3.05/pc and RMB 3.2/pc respectively. The overall overseas prices of mono-Si wafers have been marginally increased due to the impact from the exchange rate, where the quotations for G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers have arrived at US$0.4/pc and US$0.42/pc. The average price for multi-Si wafers has been reduced to RMB 1.51/W due to the stagnant downstream for the product and the previous fallback of upstream prices for multi-Si wafers.
Judging by the existing status, the large-scale and high-efficiency trends from end demand have prompted a gradually weakening demand for G1 mono-Si wafers, as well as robust quotations for M6 mono-Si wafer products of ≥166mm, and first-tier businesses have essentially signed for the orders of November. The prices of multi-Si wafers have been constantly loosening since the 4th quarter alongside its weakened demand from the downstream sector, and apart from the smaller reduction for partial high-efficiency products, the prices of other weak-and-semi-strong efficiency products are continuously descending, where the majority of businesses have commented on the substantial pressure in operation.
Cells
Continuing from the trend of last week, the overall market quotations of cells have maintained stability this week. The prices of mono-Si cells remain robust currently due to the prosperous demand for large-scale M6, M10, and M12, and sit firmly at RMB 0.9-0.3/W as the mainstream market price under restricted supply of wafers and the production capacity of cells that has yet to be fully updated. Apart from partial first-tier businesses that have been completely lined up in orders this week, all other businesses have predominantly lined up roughly two weeks of orders, with most orders centralized on M6 cells, which resulted in the relatively robust quotations for cells of M6 and above. A number of businesses are contemplating in increasing prices, though the degree of escalation is limited due to the pressure from modules, thus the average price of the M6 cell is maintained at RMB 0.92/W. On the contrary, the market share of the G1 cell is gradually depleting, where upstream G1 wafer suppliers are shifting to the build to order method, which has the advantages of stable prices and customized quotations, thought the overall G1 cells are sustaining declining prices, and first-tier businesses have preserved negotiation space for quotations.
Middle East and India remain as the primary markets for multi-Si cells, however, the aggravated pandemic status in the latter over the past several weeks has started to restrict the installation progress, which has directly impacted the demand for multi-Si cells. The incessantly contracting domestic production capacity of multi-Si cells has resulted a decline in demand from India, and the overall degree of price reduction remains relatively manageable.
Modules
The quotations for modules have sustained a minor oscillation this week, and module makers have endured apparent pressure. The end demand has been flourishing recently, though the tight supply of auxiliary materials has resulted in the quotation of partial urgent orders of photovoltaic glass to approach RMB 50/㎡. Module makers have been impeded in module shipment as they sustain increasing procurement pressure, and the continuous elevation in module cost has applied substantial pressure on businesses, where a number of second and third-tier businesses have suspended production. The 6 major domestic module makers have appealed that the uncontrolled supply and prices of glass has directly affected the normal production for module makers, and hope to obtain the understanding and support from the government and the end sector by joining hands with each sector of the supply chain in marching towards a healthy development for the photovoltaic market. On the other hand, despite the consecutive inflation of glass between September and October, the market prices of modules have been evidently increased subsequent to the polysilicon incident in mid-year. The module prices have not been significantly altered, where the average price of the 325-335 / 395-405W mono-Si PERC module is at RMB 1.54/W, and the average price of the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module has been upward adjusted to RMB 1.63/W. The continuous increment in module cost caused by the inflation of auxiliary materials this time, as well as the reduction of operating rate, and the anticipated production expansion of glass, have generated an apparent rising trend for the prices of modules during the fourth quarter, and the excess demand status will persist in the short term.
In terms of overseas markets, the pandemic status is currently aggravating in Europe and the US, and more than 10 European countries have amplified on border controls. The exacerbation of the pandemic status may derive pressure for the resumption schedule of end projects and the short-term market sentiment, thus the demand trend for the subsequent market must remain under close observation.

Polysilicon
The polysilicon market this week continues the decelerated depleting trend from October, where the domestic and overseas multi polysilicon prices continue to drop. According to the existing transaction status of the polysilicon market, there have been a few concluded orders of significant scale lately, and most businesses have been relatively cautious when signing for orders during early October amidst the declining trend of overall polysilicon prices. Looking at the prices of the orders that have been successively concluded, the quantity of orders with high price levels is gradually diminishing, and the price of mono polysilicon is generally below RMB 90/kg this week, which actuates the mainstream quotation of the product to lower to RMB 87-92/kg, with an average price of RMB 88/kg. The demand for multi polysilicon remains relatively sluggish, and the mainstream quotation has been reduced alongside the decline of the mono polysilicon market to roughly RMB 55-61/kg, with the average price now sits at RMB 58/kg. The overall closing price of polysilicon has slightly depleted due to bargaining, and the global polysilicon price has been adjusted to US$11.05/W.
Despite the continuous bargaining between the upstream and downstream sectors, the supply volume of polysilicon from Sichuan and Xinjiang amongst 11 domestic polysilicon businesses has ascended compared to October, among which the released volume subsequent to production resumption for the 4 businesses of Yongxiang, GCL, Xinte Energy, and East Hope has accounted for the majority of the supply, equaling an approximate MoM increase of 2500 tons. In addition, a total of 3 domestic businesses remain on the overhaul phase for their production lines, and a new polysilicon business in Inner Mongolia has entered overhaul, thus the monthly production volume is bound to sustain a certain degree of impact. In general, the domestic production volume of polysilicon can be expected to remain on the rising slope compared to October, and a deteriorating perspective brews in the overall polysilicon market as the upstream and downstream sectors persist in bargaining, and partial polysilicon businesses are starting to panic due to the accumulated inventory.
Wafers
The quotations of wafers have sustained a minor fluctuation this week, where the prices of multi-Si wafers continue to weaken. The existing market quotations for mono-Si wafers are relatively belligerent, and a number of first-tier businesses have fulfilled the orders for November, with no intention in adjusting the quotations temporarily. As of this week, the domestic quotations for mono-Si wafers from domestic leading businesses have been stabilized for three consecutive months, and have resulted in the unchanged prices for mono-Si wafers, where the domestic average prices for G1 and M6 remain at RMB 3.05/pc and RMB 3.2/pc respectively, whereas the overseas quotations for G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers have arrived at US$0.4/pc and US$0.42/pc respectively.
The stagnant demand from the domestic and overseas markets recently has brought turmoil to the multi-Si wafer market, where the majority of small and medium businesses have successively suspended on production capacity, though such approach has yet to stabilize the prices, as the panicking and pessimistic attitude towards the market has resulted in partial truncated prices directly impacting the mainstream quotations, and transactions of high price levels become gradually difficult for first-tier businesses. As prices are forced to loosen, the prices of weak-and-semi-strong efficiency products continue to deplete, where the domestic and overseas prices for the multi-Si wafers this week have been downward adjusted to RMB 1.35-1.55/pc and US$0.185-0.21/pc respectively, and the average prices have been weakened to RMB 1.45/pc and US$0.195/pc respectively.
Cells
The overall quotations of cells remain essentially constant this week, where the material shortage from the downstream sector has induced decelerated cell shipment for partial businesses. As the G1 mono-Si cell experiences progressively weakened market shares, the relevant prices continue to loosen, thus leading to impeded order issuances of cells on the whole. There have been businesses that have commented regarding suspended purchases from partial module clients, and that the shortage in upstream and downstream auxiliary materials has created difficulties in production, thus the average price of G1 cell is maintained at RMB 0.83/W. On the other hand, the excess demand for large-scale mono-Si cells has prompted integrated businesses to elevate the self-use ratio of cells in order to alleviate the pressure coming from the downstream sector, where a small number of urgent orders have escalated in quotations, which propelled the overall prices of large-scale cells to remain sturdy at RMB 0.92/W and US$0.12/W for the domestic and overseas average prices.
The recent fluctuations in the pandemic status for overseas have obstructed the installation progress of projects, thus introducing uncertainties to the demand for multi-Si cells. The domestic production capacity for multi-Si cells has been diminishing perpetually, with relatively more discarded market resources and chaotic prices. Despite the anchored quotations from first-tier businesses, the fewer concluded transactions this week has resulted in the overall prices of multi-Si cells being constant to that of last week, with domestic and overseas average prices sitting at RMB 0.55/W and US$0.073/W.
Modules 
The module prices have slightly increased this week, where large-scale module products have seen a rise in prices. As the cost of auxiliary materials surge continuously, a number of first-tier businesses have attempted to increase their quotations, which can be primarily seen on mono-Si M6 and above modules, and boosted the average price of the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module to RMB 1.67/W that resulted in sporadic orders for transactions, though the overall acceptance remains insignificant as the downstream sector is adhering to a stronger wait-and-see attitude. Furthermore, some module makers have commented that modules are deemed as no values in the existing market, and there are no available goods for delivery even if the end sector is willing to make exorbitant purchases as module delivery has been hindered due to the shortage of auxiliary materials.
On the contrary, the shortage of auxiliary materials has actuated the continuous ascension of glass quotations, where a number of sporadic orders for the 3.2mm glass can be concluded at RMB 50/㎡, and a mainstream concluded price of RMB 43-45/㎡. The orders of glass have not manifested signs of diminishment despite the constant static from upstream module makers pertaining to the excessive pressure in module cost, and the price of 3.2mm glass has been upward adjusted to RMB 43-50/㎡ this week, whereas the 2.0mm glass has also been inflated to roughly RMB 30-36/㎡. On the other hand, the photovoltaic industry has proposed the alleviation on the restriction of production expansion for photovoltaic glass. The policy surrounding the replacement of the production capacity for photovoltaic glass has been mitigated, though it has yet to affect the overall tight supply of photovoltaic glass, and the provision of the photovoltaic market is expected to improve gradually as leading photovoltaic glass businesses successively initiate production between the end of this year to early 2021.
The advancement progress has been differentiated for various overseas photovoltaic markets under the normalized pandemic status. European and US markets continue to impel demand, and partially controlled projects under the pandemic have been decelerated in establishment progress. The growth of the Indian market remains lower than the anticipation even under the support from the policy, and the market policies of Brazil and Chile have been sluggish in implementation, though the market end remains fiery. On the other hand, the continuous elevation in the cost of domestic module production, as well as the incessant weakening of US dollars, and the escalation in the cost of sea transportation, have introduced a certain degree of impact to the profits of overseas module shipment, which simultaneously propelled the quotations of modules in a marginal scale. The quotation of the 275-280 / 330-335W multi-Si module sits at US$0.174-0.28/W, and the average price has been risen to US$0.181/W, whereas the quotation for the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module has arrived at US$0.217-0.355/W, with the average price risen to US$0.224/W.

Polysilicon
The quotations for polysilicon continue to loosen this week, whereas the domestic and overseas prices for mono and multi polysilicon persist in a decelerated depleting trend. As the overall polysilicon market gradually releases partial production capacity, the market is now infused with an overall sufficient supply, and the prices continue to loosen. The mainstream quotation for mono polysilicon has been continuously lowered to RMB 85-90/kg, with an average price of RMB 88/kg, whereas the mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon is now at RMB 55-60/kg, with an average price of RMB 57/kg. The global polysilion markets continue to decrease in marginal degree alongside the market, and the average price has been adjusted to US$10.874/W. The overall demand for polysilicon has weakened as of this week, where most polysilicon businesses are currently in the order execution phase, thus the volume of transactions has been relatively stagnant. Partial businesses have reflected that they will focus on inquiries and observation this week due to the apparent price suppression and the slightly decelerated purchase intensity during the procurement of polysilicon, despite the robust downstream wafer quotations.
Having entered late-November, the supply volume of the domestic polysilicon market continues to surge, and 2 out of 11 operating polysilicon businesses remain in the overhaul phase. For the overseas markets, a number of businesses had essentially exported their inventory to the domestic market at the end of the third quarter, and the supply volume in November is expected to reduce compared to the initial period. Generally speaking, as domestic polysilicon businesses continue to release supply of polysilicon after production resumption, the production volume of the product is expected to elevate continuously, with the monthly production volume of polysilicon anticipated of reaching to 37K tons, before arriving at the peak of 2020 during November and December. Under the invigoration from polysilicon supply and the demand from the end market, the prices of multi polysilicon will remain on the minor deteriorating trend, and the subsequent polysilicon market will gradually enter a balanced supply and demand state along with the successive release of expansion capacity from wafer businesses.
Wafers
The wafer market is relatively quiet this week, where the overall quotations for wafers are continuing from the trends of last week. High-efficiency wafers remain on a tight supply in the current market with robust quotations. A number of businesses had completed signing the orders for mono-Si M6 during early November, which resulted in the unchanged prices of mono-Si wafers, where the domestic average prices of G1 and M6 are maintained at RMB 3.05/pc and RMB 3.2/pc respectively, whereas the overseas quotations for G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers are now US$0.4/pc and US$0.42/pc respectively. In addition, the peak quarter at the end of the year, together with the overhaul for the equipment of wafer fabs, have diminished the supply volume of mono-Si wafers for partial businesses, and have started to stabilize the prices of wafers. Looking at the demand status for various sizes of wafer products, the major demand resides on large-scale wafers, and the demand for G1 wafers remains relatively sluggish, whereas the procurement of G1 wafers has become more difficult compared to several weeks ago, with enhanced aggressiveness seen from the purchase negotiation of the cell sector
Since multi-Si wafer is regarded as a niche market, the product has essentially adopted the build to order method, and the decelerated reduction in polysilicon prices has prompted the prices of multi-Si wafers to remain stable, where domestic and overseas prices are maintained at RMB 1.45/pc and US$0.195/pc. The incessant stagnancy in the demand for multi-Si wafers has forced a number of second and third-tier businesses to exit the market successively, and the majority of orders are centralized on first-tier businesses, whereas other second and third-tier businesses are basically producing based on the obtained orders.
Cells
The overall quotations of cells remain stable this week, where the high concluded prices for large-scale products have slightly elevated. The overhaul for upstream mono-Si wafer fabs during the fourth quarter has directly impacted the supply of cell materials, and actuated the overall concluded prices of mono-Si cells to stabilize, where the high conclude prices for partial M6 cells have risen. The overall prices of large-scale cells remain sturdy right now, with the domestic and overseas average prices maintained at RMB 0.92/W and US$0.12/W respectively, however, the overhaul of wafer fabs from the past two weeks, as well as the conserved strategy pertaining to the production of G1 products adopted by cell businesses, have resulted in the static regarding material shortage for G1 cells in the market. The quotation for the specific product is currently lingering at RMB 0.85/W from first-tier businesses, and maintained at above RMB 0.8/W for second-tier businesses, for which the phenomenon has yet to be fully reflected on the prices, thus the shortage of G1 materials should be placed under observation to determine if it is an individual occurrence. The market visibility for multi-Si cells remains low, which stabilizes the quotations of the particular product, where the domestic and overseas average prices are now at RMB 0.55/W and US$0.073/W.
The cost of modules continues to ascend under the impact from the inflated quotations for auxiliary glass, and most businesses are no longer willing to accept cell orders that are now generally more expensive. An observation on the propulsion of large-scale cells indicates that the market mainstream is focused on new production expansion, whereas production lines have been established in accordance with the compatibility of G12 and below, with merely a small number of plants have transformed from G1 directory to the production lines of large-scale cells. In addition, partial businesses have obtained fewer overseas orders due to insufficient funds in production expansion, and the cell market may expedite on the elimination of the trailing production capacity in the future alongside the successively release of production capacity for large-scale cells as the transformation for the specific product is currently in a predicament.
Modules
The overall module market resides on a stabilized state with minor price increases, where the prices of mono-Si modules have slightly escalated. The quotations for auxiliary photovoltaic glass have yet to be stabilized, which continues to elevate the cost of modules. With the exacerbated bargaining between the module sector and the end market, a number of module makers are unable to withstand the pressure, and have been forced to implement a severe inflation so as to propel partial order conclusion. The quotations for modules this week are extending from the trends of last week, where several makers are attempting to raise the prices, which resulted in the quotation increase for the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si PERC module to RMB 1.54-1.67/W, with an upward adjustment to RMB 1.57/W for the average price, whereas the quotation for the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si module has been adjusted to RMB 1.64-1.72/W, with the average price maintained at RMB 1.67/W.
Regarding multi-Si modules, although the overall operating rate of modules has been impacted by the inflation and material shortage from the supply chain, the pandemic status in overseas and the weaker demand for multi-Si modules have provided support for the domestic and overseas quotations to remain sturdily at RMB 1.35/W and US$0.181/W this week. On the other hand, looking at the recent domestic tenders of modules, the tender and bid prices in November have increased evidently compared to the third quarter, and state-owned businesses have announced the procurement project of the 5GW module that initiated the photovoltaic tender in China for 2021, which has 5 times the procurement scale than the 1GW tender during 2020, and covers multi-Si and large-scale (≥166) mono-Si modules, indicating the certainty of domestic installation and development, as well as the demand trend of large-scale modules, in 2021.
In terms of auxiliary materials, the overall quotations of photovoltaic glass have decelerated this week amidst the inflation, among which the 3.2mm glass has been upward adjusted to RMB 44-50/㎡ from the continuous price increase, whereas the 2.0mm glass has surged to RMB 32-36/㎡. First-tier module makers have been signing long-term orders with photovoltaic glass businesses since the third quarter in order to guarantee a provision that will cover the next two years, though the insufficient supply from the market has resulted in the perpetual quotation increase for glass, with transactions successively concluded. A number of businesses have commented that the existing production capacity for glass is extremely constrained, and the quotations for the product will not subside within the short term.

Polysilicon
The quotations for polysilicon have slightly decreased this week, and the overall reduction of the polysilicon market has decelerated evidently. The volume of concluded transactions has not increased with the continuous decrement of polysilicon quotations from weeks ago, and the downstream sector remains cautious on procurement, where the majority of polysilicon businesses are no longer lowering prices blindly, thus the overall reduction has decelerated. The high-level quotation for mono polysilicon has slightly dropped, and the mainstream quotation is now at RMB 85-88/kg, with an average price of RMB 86/kg. The multi polysilicon market has been affected by the depleted end demand, and the weakened demand for downstream cells and wafers has transmitted to multi polysilicon, which is unable to maintain its high price, where the mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon has been lowered to RMB 55-60/kg this week, with an average price of 56/kg. The global polysilicon prices continue to drop marginally, and the average price has been adjusted to US$10.841/W alongside the decelerated decrease of mono and multi polysilicon quotations. Orders for December are expected to enter official negotiation next year, where prices may gradually improve then.
Two suppliers among 11 domestic operating polysilicon businesses are currently at the overhaul phase as the end of the month approaches, and the reduced production volume in polysilicon for the month was induced by the equipment maintenance and small-scale overhaul of 3 polysilicon businesses. The status of supply and demand for polysilicon is expected for a continuous optimization in early 2021 as businesses, such as GCL and Yongxiang, increase in production volume. Simultaneously, the expansion of the polysilicon market in 2020 is primarily guided by leading businesses of GCL-Poly, Tongwei, and Asia Silicon, and the Matthew effect becomes increasingly obvious as small and medium businesses continue to diminish on the total volume. With essentially no additional production capacity for polysilicon in the first half of 2021, the next round of production peak will be centralized on the period between the second half of 2021 and 2022, where the market share of leading domestic polysilicon businesses will ascend once again then.
Wafers
The quotations for wafers have slightly increased this week, where domestic and overseas prices for mono-Si wafers have escalated. Leading mono-Si wafer businesses have announced the list prices for December this week, which saw a minor increase in the quotations for G1 products, and stabilized quotations for M6 and above products, whereas the overseas quotations continue to rise in marginal degree due to the impact from the exchange rate. The previously weakened demand for G1 mono-Si wafer resulted in the downward adjustment in G1 wafer supply, where the supply and demand for M6 remains flourishing, though the end sector’s overall compelling demand for mono-Si wafers has led to the increasing difficulty for downstream procurement compared to several weeks ago, which prompted the bargaining power of G1. On the other hand, the new production capacity of wafers during the fourth quarter did not conform to the anticipation, which generated an inflation trend in M6 mono-Si wafers that are relatively tight in supply. In contrast to the stabilized status earlier, the domestic quotations for wafers have risen this week, where the domestic average prices for G1 and M6 are now at RMB 3.13/pc and 3.32/pc respectively. The demand for multi-Si wafers continues to be stagnant, and businesses are producing based on the obtained orders, with the average price maintained at RMB 1.45/pc. Looking at the existing quotations of the wafer market, the majority of businesses have yet to implement price adjustments apart from partial first-tier businesses that have followed the footsteps of leading wafer businesses in adjusting prices, though the relevant alteration may gradually appear next week.
Compared with the domestic robust quotations for mono-Si wafers, the overseas quotations for mono-Si wafers have been increasing marginally for two consecutive months, where the mainstream quotations for G1 and M6 have arrived at US$0.417-0.422/pc and US$0.431-0.436/pc respectively this week, with a respective average price of US$0.41/pc and US$0.435/pc. The prices of multi-Si wafers have been constantly loosening since the fourth quarter, and the sluggish end demand from overseas has forced multi-Si wafer businesses to remain on a low volume production, where the weakened price lingers at US$0.195/pc.
Cells
Having generally stabilized this week, the quotations of cells are exhibiting signs of elevation within the short term under the relatively strained supply of mono-Si G1 resources. The prices of multi-Si cells did not experience a large fluctuation this week, with the domestic and overseas average prices arriving at RMB 0.55/W and US$0.073/W. The demand for the supply of multi-Si cells can no longer be reflected on the prices, and the prices of cells are dependent on the quotations of wafers. Regarding mono-Si cells, the overall prices remain constant under the vigorous demand this quarter, as well as the stabilized wafer prices, where the average prices of G1 and M6 cells are maintained at RMB 0.83/W and RMB 0.92/W respectively. The provision of G1 resources has diminished profoundly on the market due to the partial migration of production capacity for G1 cells, and the growth in G1 orders is becoming evident as the downstream sector ascends preference in G1 products, where the quotations for partial recent sporadic orders are on the verge of rising.
The concern over the shortage of mono-Si cells persists, and that the market is deriving static regarding a negotiation on the demand for auxiliary materials in cells and modules prior to Chinese New Year in 2021, in order to avoid material shortage or inflation. On the other hand, as leading cell businesses adjust the quotations for December and reveal the pricing of large-scale products, the overall cell prices have gradually returned to the ideal range compared to the third quarter, and the supply of large-scale products has become the market focus.
Modules
There have been no apparent fluctuations in the quotations for modules this week, and the subsequent module quotations are expected to rise amidst the stabilized status as the overall market price continues to escalate. The module quotations for this week have continued from the trend of last week, where the quotation for the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si PERC module is maintained at RMB 1.54-1.67/W, with an average price of RMB 1.57/W, and the quotation for the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module is now at RMB 1.64-1.72/W, with an average price of RMB 1.67/W. For the domestic market, the installation volume in October continued to rise, and there has been an apparent increase in projects between the end of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 for the delivery period of module tender and bids, which indicates that that the flourishing domestic demand in the fourth quarter will extend to early 2021. As for the overseas markets, the emerging market has received alleviation from the continuous fluctuations in the pandemic status for Europe and America, and that various regions are adhering to a stabilized policy orientation regarding clean energy including photovoltaic, thus the pandemic is expected to generate a large impact to the establishment of short-term projects than the demand of the subsequent market.
The prices of photovoltaic glass are gradually stabilized after a period of inflation, of which the 3.2mm glass is now at RMB 44-50/㎡, and the 2.0mm glass now sits at RMB 32-36/㎡. The module market is no longer tied up by having better equipped itself in the face of the recent glass shortage, and may experience further improvement with the possible announcement of pricing for December from glass businesses next week. Module makers are currently at the presentation phase, and have yet to initiate the negotiation for the orders of next month, where most first-tier businesses and glass businesses are going to announce the pricing for December next week. Judging by the market feedback, the overall pricing may continue to rise, and that the module market is likely to extend to the end of December under the impact from the cost of raw materials and the support derived from the demand in the fourth quarter.

Polysilicon
The polysilicon market continues on the decelerated decreasing trend this week, where quotations of mono and multi polysilicon continue to loosen. Most multi polysilicon businesses are maintaining relatively higher operate rate recently, and the supply of polysilicon on the market became comparatively sufficient, which resulted in a weaker ability for conclusion during negotiation, and the dominance that downstream procurement grasps on has generated successive signing of polysilicon orders, though with continuously declining conclusion prices. The quotation of mono polysilicon fell back this week, where the mainstream quotation is at RMB 82-85/kg, with an average price of RMB 84/kg. Multi polysilicon has sustained an even more apparent impact from the reduction of end demand, where multi polysilicon businesses are constantly compromising on conclusion prices due to the pressure derived from the sales of inventory. The mainstream quotation for multi polysilicon had been reduced to RMB 52-56/kg, with the average price now sitting at RMB 54/kg. The global polysilicon prices continue to decline marginally as the quotations for mono and multi polysilicon continue to deplete, where the average price has been adjusted to US$10.588/W.
An observation on the production and operation plans of various polysilicon businesses indicates that among 11 operating domestic polysilicon businesses, those who went into overhaul in November have successively resumed operation, and 2 of the 11 businesses are gradually releasing production capacity after the completion of equipment maintenance and small overhaul, and another domestic business is expected to resume operation in mid-December, which actuates a further improvement in the domestic production volume of polysilicon compared to November. With the replenishment of overseas polysilicon, the demand and supply of the market is expected to continue to be optimized by the end of the year, and a minor fallback in prices from the recent bargaining between upstream and downstream sectors in the polysilicon market is also seen.
Wafers
Most businesses have successively signed for the orders of December this week, and the quotations of the wafer market remain robust on the whole. Judging by the market condition, the supply of the G1 market has decreased due to the previously lowered demand for G1 cells, though the upgrades in the mono-Si wafer production lines in the fourth quarter has generated a certain degree of demand in G1 wafers for the downstream sector, which prompts the continuous shipment of G1 wafers recently. Simultaneously, the demand of the M6 wafer market remains flourishing, and the gross profit of large-scale products are slowly rising under the decelerated reduction of upstream polysilicon prices. Hence, most wafer businesses have followed up on quotations after leading wafer businesses announced the list prices for December, and propels the domestic and overseas prices of G1 and M6 mono-Si wafers to remain stabilized on the whole, where the domestic average prices of G1 and M6 wafers are now at RMB 3.13/pc and RMB 3.23/pc respectively, whereas the mainstream overseas quotations for G1 and M6 wafers have arrived at US$0.417-0.422/pc and US$0.431-0.436/pc respectively, with the average prices sitting at US$0.42/pc and US$0.435/pc respectively.
The weak prices of multi-Si wafers remain stabilized this week under the impact from the prolonged sluggish downstream demand, and multi-Si wafer businesses continue to produce in low volume, where the domestic average price is maintained at RMB 1.45/pc, whereas overseas prices are sitting at roughly US$0.195/pc. On the other hand, the market is seeing a gradual increase in the volume of large-scale wafer products, and EnergyTrend has incorporated the quotations for M10 and G12 wafers this week, with a respective average price of RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc. As first-tier businesses successively sign for 2021 or long orders that last for several years in the large-scale wafer market, this round of transformation and upgrades in the production lines of wafers, as well as the sequential release of new production capacity, are expected to accelerate the exit of trailing wafer production capacity with sluggish market demand and insufficient economic efficiency.
Cells
The overall quotations of cells remain sturdy this week, and the tendency in promoting large-scale cell products is evident. As leading cell businesses adjust the quotations for December, and disclose the pricing of large-scale specifications, the overall cell prices have gradually returned to the ideal range compared to the third quarter. Apart from the relatively strained demand for mono-Si G1 cells, the production and marketing of other large-scale cells remains balanced, which impels the average prices of G1 and M6 cells to arrive at RMB 0.83/W and RMB 0.92/W, whereas large-scale product M10 and G12 cells are now sitting at RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc for the respective average prices. It is worth noting that the material shortage for G1 and large-scale cells several weeks ago is now progressively alleviated, and the current prices of the cell market are balanced. The prices of G1 cells may face further downward adjustments if the demand for the product stays in stasis during the first quarter of 2021.
In contrast, the market of multi-Si wafers has not experienced major fluctuations, where prices are fundamentally constant to that of last week, though the market demand is starting to exhibit stagnancy, and the conclusion prices are also declining. Primary businesses have yet to adjust the quotations, and the domestic and overseas average prices are RMB 0.55/W and US$0.073/W as of this week.
Modules
The quotations for modules are generally stable this week, and the severe shortage of glass has been somewhat mitigated. A number of module makers are on the verge of increasing their prices, especially with mono-Si modules, though the module market has yet to follow on the price rise from partial module makers in November, and the conclusion prices have yet to elevate substantially. Most module makers are adhering to the initial standard when signing for the orders of December this week, where the quotation for the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si PERC module is now at RMB 1.54-1.67/W, with an average price of RMB 1.57/W, whereas the quotation for the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module is maintained at RMB 1.64-1.72/W, with an average price of RMB 1.67/W.
The quotations of glass have remained stable this week, among which the price of 3.2mm glass now sits at RMB 44-50/㎡, and the price of 2.0mm glass has arrived at RMB 32-36/㎡. Under the previously exacerbated supply of photovoltaic glass, module makers and downstream suppliers have started to consider using float glass of comparatively cheaper cost and simpler processing procedure instead of the traditional roll glass, as well as the transparent backplane solution, as the replenishment for the existing void of glass products, which has marginally alleviated the severe shortage of glass previously. Despite the cheaper raw materials and simpler processing procedure of ultra-white float glass, the replacement over roll glass will introduce loss of module power and instability from long-term usage, which has not successfully captured the fancy of downstream clients. Generally speaking, the tight supply of glass has somewhat mitigated as module makers and end clients negotiate on postponed shipment and the adoption of glass replacement, and the high-level orders from second and third-tier businesses are gradually diminishing. With prices progressively returning to the high level, the overall market quotations are marching towards stability.

Polysilicon 
The quotations of polysilicon are starting to suspend in reduction and become sturdy, where the reduction of mono and multi polysilicon has decelerated compared to the previous period. The majority of polysilicon businesses have successively signed for the orders of December, with fewer concluded transactions seen from this week, and the quotations remain predominantly constant to that of last week, which resulted in the diminishment in the price reduction of mono polysilicon, where the price has approached RMB 80/kg as of this week, with an average price of RMB 82/kg. The overall supply of multi polysilicon has been relatively insufficient due to the incomplete production resumption from several major polysilicon businesses, and the slight depletion in the prices has decelerated the reduction of polysilicon prices, where the mainstream quotation has been downward adjusted to RMB 51-55/kg, with the average price now sitting at RMB 53/kg. As the end of the year approaches, the inventory pull from the polysilicon end has weakened from the lowered installation demand, and buyers are not rushing to draw inventory as the mono polysilicon market has enough inventory right now. With the contraction of mono and multi polysilicon quotations, the global polysilicon prices continue to decline marginally, and the average price has been adjusted to US$10.588/W.
An observation on the production and operation plans of various polysilicon businesses indicates that 1 among 11 operating polysilicon businesses is expected to resume operation during mid-December after overhaul, and the overall monthly production volume of domestic polysilicon is expected to arrive at 38K tons in December as domestic polysilicon businesses continue to release production capacity after operation resumption. Judging by the existing status, the fewer concluded orders recently have led to the continuous loosening of quotations, though the reduction has diminished substantially, and downstream businesses have planned to stock as polysilicon businesses began successive release of production capacity, thus prices are anticipated to be stabilized within the next two weeks.
Wafers
The wafer market remains fundamentally stable this week, where multi-Si wafers have slightly reduced in prices. The relatively tight supply of mono-Si wafers has yet to be alleviated, and the robust quotations have resulted in a behavior of fishing in troubled waters among partial small businesses, which actuated the domestic quotations of G1 and M6 wafers to maintain at RMB 3.13/pc and RMB 3.23/pc respectively, and the mainstream overseas quotations of G1 and M6 wafers are now at US$0.417-0.422/pc and US$0.431-0.436/pc respectively. The prices of large-scale products continue to stabilize, where the average prices of M10 and G12 wafers are now at RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc respectively. Generally speaking, the mono-Si wafer market is experiencing a strained demand in spots, and leading businesses are gradually releasing new production capacity of wafers, where first-tier businesses are essentially balanced between production and sales, and the difficulty in purchasing from second-tier businesses has increased, which largely conforms to the market status of December from past years.
The quotations of multi-Si wafers are unable to stabilize due to the incessant stagnancy in the end demand, as well as the loosened quotations of multi polysilicon from the upstream sector, and have dropped by RMB 0.02-0.03/pc this week, where the domestic average price has declined to RMB 1.43/pc, and the overseas prices has been adjusted to roughly US$0.194/pc.
Cells
The overall quotations of the cell market have slightly differentiated this week, where mono-Si cells remain sturdy in quotations, and the quotations of multi-Si cells continue to loosen. The overall market tendency of the cell sector bears resemblances to that of upstream wafer sector, where multi-Si products are robust in quotations due to the restricted supply of resources, and a number of sporadic orders have increased in prices, which propelled the average price of G1 and M6 cells to remain at RMB 0.83/W and RMB 0.92/W respectively, whereas the average prices of large-scale products M10 and G12 cells are sitting at RMB 0.96/W and RMB 0.97/W respectively. Multi-Si cells are sluggish in the overall demand, where the early fermentation of overseas demand in inventory pull, together with the completed domestic orders of household and distributed projects, have resulted in the loosening prices of each segment of the supply chain, and the price of multi-Si cells has begun lowering to RMB 0.52-0.58/W, with the average price now at RMB 0.54/W.
Looking at the overall market, as the upsurge in inventory pull draws to a close at the end of the year, mid-December will become the shipment schedule for the supply chain market, and the production of each sector of the photovoltaic industry will enter the decelerated phase subsequently. The stocking status of the supply chain before Chinese New Year will decide if the downstream market is able to continue the intensity in inventory pull, and impel the overall price trends.
Modules
The prices of modules are generally stabilized this week, where multi-Si modules have slightly dropped in prices. Most first-tier businesses had finished the signing of December orders last week, and are currently in the order delivering phase. The overall quotations of the market remain sturdy, and the demand for mono-Si modules still provide vigorous support for the quotations. There have been no significant changes while signing for the majority of the module orders for December this week, where the average price of the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si PERC module sits firmly at RMB 1.57/W, and the quotation of the 355-365 / 425-435W mono-Si PERC module is maintained at roughly RMB 1.67/W. The quotations for 182mm and 210mm modules have been added this week, where both are sitting at RMB 1.66-1.78/W and an average price of RMB 1.72/pc. Looking at the recent domestic tender and bid status, the continuous escalation in the demand for 500W+ modules indicate that the construction solutions with large-scale products have been recognized by end businesses. On the other hand, the overall quotation range has seen a relatively large fluctuation, especially with the apparent differences in the quotations of single-sided and bifacial glass under the same version, have suggested that module businesses are differentiated in terms of the anticipation of the subsequent market prices and pricing strategies.
The quotations of glass remain stable this week, of which the price of 3.2mm glass now sits at RMB 44-50/㎡, and the price of 2.0mm glass has arrived at approximately RMB 32-36/㎡. With the progressively diminishing high-level orders from second and third-tier businesses, prices are gradually returning to the high level, and the quotations of glass are retracting back to rationality compared to late November, though the tight supply of glass is still evident. Pertaining to overseas markets, the European and US markets have exhibited differentiation due to the pandemic. Benefitting from the rigorous lockdown measures that started from early November, the second wave of outbreak in Europe has been substantially improved, where logistics and the progress of power plants are expected to become unhindered. The US currently has about 14 states that are in the midst of reinforced travel restrictions, and the pandemic prevention of the country will be weaker than that of Europe due to the later adoption of measures and the number of states that still allow entries. Under this particular background, the resumption of US photovoltaic projects will continue to sustain relevant pressure.

Polysilicon
The quotations for polysilicon have gradually stabilized this week, with slight increases in partial quotations. As downstream wafer businesses are starting to exhibit hoarding of mono polysilicon, the majority of polysilicon businesses have completed all orders for December, and a number of sporadic quotations have suspended in reduction, which actuated the mainstream quotations for mono polysilicon to arrive at RMB 80-84/kg this week, with the average price maintained at RMB 82/kg. In terms of multi polysilicon, the overall market quotations are currently in a buffer period of declination, and the suspended prices have propelled the mainstream quotations for multi polysilicon to linger at RMB 51-55/kg, with an average price of RMB 53/kg.
An observation on the production and operation plans of various polysilicon businesses indicates that the 1 among 11 operating polysilicon businesses is expected to gradually resume operation in late December, and the monthly production volume of domestic polysilicon is expected to approach 38K tons as the overall supply of polysilicon continues to elevate. On the whole, the imminent arrival of the stocking period prior to Chinese New Year has stimulated the short-term demand for polysilicon, where the conclusion of partial sporadic and urgent orders have provided momentum for the average prices of polysilicon to rise again. On the other hand, the gradual release of downstream wafer production capacity has further impelled the overall demand for polysilicon, and with no additional projects and production of polysilicon in the first half of 2021, the excess demand will persist in the polysilicon market, which provides support in price stabilization for polysilicon right now.
Wafers
The overall quotations for wafers are stabilized this week, where the supply and demand of mono-Si and multi-Si wafers are relatively sturdy. Most first-tier businesses in the wafer market are currently in the presentation phase, with a relatively low volume of concluded transactions in wafers. Amongst all segmented products, the supply of G1 wafer resources remain constrained this week, where the domestic and overseas average prices are maintained at RMB 3.13/pc and US$0.42/pc respectively, and the tight supply in G1 is expected to last until the end of the year.
Under the spur of downstream demand, most mono-Si wafer businesses have shifted to the production of M6 in the fourth quarter, which stabilized the supply of M6 wafers, for which the domestic and overseas average prices dwell at RMB 3.23/pc and US$0.435/pc. The prices of large-scale products remain robust, of which the average prices for M10 and G12 wafers are sitting at RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc respectively.
As for multi-Si wafer, the production end of the particular product category and multi-Si cells have transitioned the relevant production capacity to mono-Si products, and a comparatively balanced supply and demand has been observed. In addition, the quotations for multi-Si wafers have stabilized in lower prices this week due to the insignificant degree of profit from the product, where the domestic average price is now at RMB 1.43/pc, and the overseas price is maintained at roughly US$0.194/pc.
Cells
The cell market has slightly recovered this week, where the quotations for both G1 and M6 mono-Si cells have risen. Judging by the overall market, the procurement of various cell products in the supply chain is stabilized, and is no longer affected by the installation rush at year end. Owing to vigorous demand, the obtainment of low-prices resources has become severely difficult under the continuously tight supply of mono-Si G1 resources. A number of G1 sporadic quotations have risen by approximately RMB 0.02/W, and the overall average price of G1 cells has been upward adjusted to RMB 0.84/W, with the overseas average price being US$0.114/W. Mono-Si M6 cells are similar to that of last week’s status, where most businesses are optimistic towards the demand in the first quarter of 2021, with the majority of demand prior to Chinese New Year showing willingness in early arrangement. The average price of M6 has slightly increased to RMB 0.93/W, with the overseas price maintained sturdily at US$0.124/W. The supply and quotations for large-scale M10 and G12 cells remain stable at a respective average price of RMB 0.96/W and RMB 0.97/W.
Regarding the market of multi-Si cells, the end demand has yet to be manifested in an extensive degree, and the upstream production capacity for multi-Si cells is gradually diminishing, where the quotations for multi-Si cells from operating first-tier businesses are remaining constant. The price of multi-Si cells remains robust at RMB 0.52-0.58/W, whereas the domestic and overseas average prices are now at RMB 0.54/W and US$0.073/W respectively.
Modules
The prices of modules are generally stabilized as the end of the year approaches, and the module market is focused on presentation. The overall quotations for modules have become steadfast this week, where a large portion of first-tier businesses are currently in the order delivering phase, with fewer new orders, thus the mainstream quotations have yet to sustain apparent adjustments. The average price of the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si module is sitting firmly at RMB 1.57/W and US$0.212/W, and the quotation for the 355-365/425-435W mono-Si module is maintained at RMB 1.67/W and US$0.226/W. A number of businesses have commented that with the progressive increase in the cost of modules actuated by the rise in auxiliary material quotations, the willingness in increasing module quotations has relatively ascended in overseas, where the domestic spot quotations are temporarily stabilized. Large-scale modules remain robust in quotations, of which the 182 module is quoted at RMB 1.66-1.78/W, with an average price of RMB 1.72/pc, whereas the 210 module is quoted at RMB 1.66-1.78/W, with an average price of RMB 1.72/pc. Looking at the installation status for this year, the distributed market exhibits tenacity under the impact from the pandemic, and the household photovoltaic installation from the domestic market has exceeded 10GW in 2020 so far, which has significant surpassed the initial planning during the start of the year. Distributed markets in Germany, Poland, and Brazil continue to grow vigorously. The distributed market remains promising under the continuous optimization as well as the promotion and application of large-scale modules on the cost of projects.
The market photovoltaic glass is on a steady trend this week, where the 3.2mm glass sits at RMB 44-50/㎡, and the 2.0mm glass sits at roughly RMB 32-36/㎡. As the national policy recently alleviated on the restrictions imposed on the expansion of photovoltaic roll glass, the tight supply of photovoltaic glass will be gradually resolved, and the overall prices of glass in 2021 are expected to be more rational than that of second half of 2020, where glass is considered as having no values. On the other hand, the severe shortage of glass has yet to be resolved despite the termination in the incessant rising trend recently, and the market status of glass is expected to slightly recover after the conclusion of the subsequent wave of installation.

Polysilicon 
Downstream procurement and stocking has been aggressive this week, with polysilicon prices bottoming out. As the end of the year approaches, a number of businesses have begun negotiating for the orders of January, and the overall supply of polysilicon is gradually exhibiting a strained tendency. The successive conclusion of partial sporadic orders after inflation has given a good signal for the polysilicon market, which actuated the mainstream prices of mono polysilicon to rise to RMB 81-85/kg this week, with an average price of RMB 83/kg. In terms of the multi polysilicon market, the overall prices have suspended in reduction after the buffer period of declination, and has yet to exhibit a clear ascending trend in the subsequent market, though a price rise is ready to wriggle owing to the pull of mono polysilicon. The mainstream quotations for multi polysilicon is currently at RMB 51-55/kg, with the average price slightly increased to RMB 54/kg.
An observation on the production and operation plans of various polysilicon businesses indicates that there are currently 2 among 11 operating polysilicon businesses that are in the midst of overhaul due to a specific overhaul business that did not resume operation according to schedule, and the additional single business that entered a small-scale overhaul that has impacted the supply volume of polysilicon. The two businesses are expected to complete overhaul and resume operation in late December and early January. On the whole, as wafer businesses are expected to increase the demand for mono polysilicon during 2021, most polysilicon businesses have signed with the downstream sector on long-term orders for 2021. The successive release of expanded production capacity from wafer businesses has stimulated the demand for polysilicon in the short term as the hoarding and stocking period prior to the Chinese New Year arrives, and the conclusion of partial sporadic urgent orders on inflated prices has provided support for polysilicon prices in bottoming out.
Wafers 
Wafer prices are overall stable this week, with a number of wafer businesses reflecting on the relatively tight supply of the market. With the arrival of the end of the month, businesses in each sector of the supply chain started to stock up in raw materials prior to the Chinese New Year in 2021, where most businesses are currently in the negotiation phase for January prices, and the overall market is waiting on the successive order singing after the announcement of list prices from first-tier businesses, which resulted in wafer prices being constant to that of last week, among which the domestic and overseas overage prices of G1 and M6 wafers are maintained at RMB 3.13/pc & US$0.42/pc, and RMB 3.23/pc and US$0.435 respectively. The prices of large-scale products remain robust, of which the average prices for M10 and G12 wafers are sitting at RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc respectively. In addition, a number of mono-Si wafer businesses have reflected on the increasing numbers of recent orders and the overall excess demand market status, where partial urgent and sporadic orders have been successively concluded after an inflation of RMB 0.03-0.05/pc.
Upstream businesses are exhibiting intentions in upward adjusting the quotations for multi-Si wafers, though the supply and demand, as well as quotations, are relatively sturdy for the existing market, and businesses are still adhering to the build to order method, which propelled the current quotations for multi-Si wafers to remain constant to that of last week, with the domestic average price now at RMB 1.43/pc, and the overseas average price sitting at roughly US$0.194/pc.
Cells
The quotations for cells are predominantly stabilized this week, with marginal escalation in G1 cells. Module makers have been actively negotiating with cell businesses on orders and market demand this week, and partial end projects have been postponed to January 2021 for grid connection, apart from the stocking period prior to the Chinese New Year. The quotations for mono-Si cells are sturdy in the current stage, with cell businesses in the midst of delivering all shipment, and the majority of first-tier businesses are currently in the order delivering phase, where the overall quotations remain stable. However, the continuous tension in the supply of upstream wafers had directly impacted the production of second and third-tier businesses, and even resulted in partial orders not being delivered on time. In terms of mono-Si cells, the quotations for a number of G1 orders have risen due to the relatively fewer market supply, and the rise in G1 order quotations has impelled the average price of G1 cells to increase to RMB 0.86/W this week, and the overseas average price now sits at US$0.116/W. Bearing similarities to that of last week, the domestic and overseas average prices of M6 cells are maintained at RMB 0.93/W and US$0.124/W.
As for multi-Si cells, the end demand remains sluggish, and market visibility remains low, where a number of multi-Si wafers and cells have transitioned to the production of mono-Si products or exited the market, which resulted in overall stable mainstream quotations for multi-Si cells. The domestic cell price sits firmly at RMB 0.52-0.58/W, whereas the domestic and overseas average prices are now at RMB 0.54/W and US$0.073/W.
Modules
The termination in the installation rush for a number of projects at the end of the year has resulted in a recovering tendency for module orders, and prompted the prices of modules to remain stable this week, where the average prices of the 325-335W/395-405W mono-Si module remains sturdily at RMB 1.57/W and US$0.212/W, and the average prices of the 355-365/425-435W mono-Si module lingers at RMB 1.67/W and US$0.226/W. First-tier module makers have started negotiating for the overseas orders in January, and the overall operating rate has not been affected profoundly, whereas second and third-tier module makers are planning to reduce the operating rate in order to respond to the depleting demand during the first quarter of 2021. Regarding the tender market, a number of recent large-scale group purchases from central enterprises indicate that the supply of modules will be centralized within the first three quarters next year, and the bidding modules contain evidently higher power to those of 2020, whereas the substantially elevated demand for large-scale modules exhibits the apparent trend in leaning towards large-scale products. On the other hand, domestic module makers have reflected that the overseas market started negotiating for the spot prices of the first quarter of 2021 due to the time limit on grid connection for the purchasing end, and are hoping for a reduction in quotations, though uncertainties persist as a result of the tight supply of wafers and cells, as well as the stabilized prices in the glass market. Under this particular market status, the overall module prices are still relatively stabilized, however, partial second and third-tier businesses may adjust prices in the hope of obtaining additional orders.
The market of photovoltaic glass continues to stabilize this week, where the 3.2mm glass sits at RMB 44-50/㎡, and the 2.0mm glass is at roughly RMB 32-36/㎡. Most businesses are currently in the order delivering phase, and have yet to fully initiate the negotiation and quotations for the orders of next month, with new pricing expected to be announced by first-tier businesses at the end of the month. Partial businesses in the market have reflected that the investment in photovoltaic roll glass still contains a higher threshold, where the supply of glass in the short term may be lower than the market anticipation after taking into account factors of the cycles of production capacity commencement and yield rate, and that robust or slightly elevated quotations serve as the indicator in determining the market status of glass.

Polysilicon 
Quotations of polysilicon are continuing to recover this week, with a significant increase in the scale of purchase seen from the market. As the Chinese New Year holiday approaches, the downstream wafer market is starting to amplify on stocking, and the demand for mono polysilicon has drastically risen in particular, with an increase of roughly RMB 2/kg for the market price, which continues to elevate the mainstream price of mono polysilicon to RMB 82-87/kg, with an average price of RMB 85/kg. In terms of multi polysilicon, the relatively weaker future demand has resulted in insufficient stocking dynamics for businesses, and that the previously incomplete production resumption from a certain primary multi polysilicon businesses has also induced a comparatively stabilized provision of multi polysilicon, which actuated the mainstream quotations of multi polysilicon to RMB 51-55/kg this week, with the average price sitting sturdily at RMB 54/kg.
An observation on the production and operation plans of various polysilicon businesses indicates that the overall domestic supply volume of polysilicon has reduced by roughly 34K tons as two additional 10,000-level businesses among 11 operating polysilicon businesses had initiated overhaul, which impacted the supply of polysilicon, and that several businesses have yet to arrive at full load due to small maintenance. On the whole, the domestic production volume of polysilicon was at 100.4K tons in the fourth quarter of 2020, and two businesses had entered overhaul and maintenance each month on average that impacted the supply of the polysilicon market; despite the persisting excess demand status for the polysilicon market, the supply void has been substantially improved compared to the third quarter. The propulsion derived from the downstream stocking is expected to stimulate the overall demand for polysilicon, and polysilicon may continue to rise in prices.
Wafers 
The overall prices of wafers continue to stabilize this week, with a relatively tight supply of mono-Si wafers. As leading businesses announced the unchanged pricing of wafers for January at the end of December, most businesses have successively followed up on the direction that resulted in temporarily stabilized prices, and the January orders of first-tier mono-Si wafer businesses are almost full, which attributes to the continuously strained supply. G1 wafers in particular have been reduced in supply volume due to the size transition from the midstream market, which induced a rise in the bargaining power of G1 and difficulties in obtaining low price resources, where partial new orders of G1 mono-Si wafers are preparing to increase in prices. The overseas quotation for G1 has slightly elevated to roughly US$0.422, whereas the domestic price remains robust at RMB 3.31/pc. Pertaining to large-scale wafers, the trailing progress in the production of new projects from the wafer market during the fourth quarter has prompted the relatively steady prices for various wafer products, among which the domestic and overseas average prices of M6 wafer are currently at RMB 3.23/pc and US$0.435/pc respectively, and the average prices for M10 and G12 wafers are RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc respectively.
Multi-Si wafer businesses are essentially producing based on the build to order method, and there have been no major changes in the quotations of multi-Si wafers owing to the stabilized upstream prices after the minor increase, as well as the gradually steady quotations for mono-Si wafers, thus prompting the domestic and overseas average prices to sit at RMB 1.43/pc and US$0.194/pc respectively.
Cells
Quotations for cells are overall sturdy this week, with minor escalation in the quotations for mono-Si G1 cells. The supply of resources is progressively diminishing in the market alongside the gradual contraction in the production capacity for mono-Si G1 cells, though the insignificant reduction of demand has generated the recent moderate increment in the concluded prices of G1 cells, where a number of orders were concluded at above RMB 0.9/W, which impelled the average price of G1 cells to RMB 0.89/W this week, with an overseas average price at US$0.12/W. For large-scale products, the demand for high-efficiency resources such as M6, M10, and G12 has exhibited subsiding trends, though the concluded prices of the market remain stable right now, and the sign of a minor depletion may appear in the first quarter of 2021 if demand is not continuously invigorated then. The domestic and overseas average prices of M6 cell sits at RMB 0.93/W and US$0.124 this week, whereas the average prices for M10 and G12 wafers are now at RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc.
There have been no apparent fluctuations in the supply and demand for multi-Si cells, and the quotations for cells are stabilized under robust upstream prices, which led to the overall sturdy mainstream quotation of multi-Si cells this week, where domestic cell price sits at RMB 0.52-0.58/W, with domestic and overseas average prices at RMB 0.54/W and US$ 0.073/W.
Modules 
The overall quotations for the module market are stabilized this week as a reduction has yet to be seen from cell prices and auxiliary material cost from the upstream sector. In the face of an expected fall back in demand during the first quarter of 2021, most existing new orders in the market are centralized on first-tier businesses, and orders for second and third-tier businesses are somewhat stagnant. The prices of raw materials for modules are comparatively sturdy right now, which prompted for a stable market status on the whole, where the average prices of the 325-335W/395-405W and the 355-365/425-435W mono-Si module sit firmly at RMB 1.57/W and US$0.212/W as well as RMB 1.67/W and US$0.226/W respectively.
Large-scale modules are stable in prices, where the average price of the 182/210 mono-Si PERC module is now at RMB 1.72/W. The demand for 500W+ high efficiency modules has been frequently seen from downstream module tenders during the fourth quarter, and the industry has pointed at the development of large-scale modules, despite the differences in the specific sizes. As the new production capacity that is able to enter extensive mass production, large-scale modules are equipped with the foundation for promoting in the downstream market, and the particular product has become the primary direction for the industry chain of the photovoltaic industry in cost reduction for 2021.
Photovoltaic glass remains stable in prices this week, where 3.2mm is now at RMB 44-50/㎡, and 2.0mm is now priced at approximately RMB 32-36/㎡. Judging by the new orders for January, the popularity of photovoltaic glass has yet to subside, and the concluded prices are still relatively robust, where partial sporadic orders are concluded at additional RMB 1-2/㎡.

Polysilicon 
The advanced stocking from the downstream sector has resulted in the overall recovery of the polysilicon market, where the quotations of polysilicon continue to rise this week. Partial mono polysilicon orders have significantly increased in volume as the demand for downstream purchases gradually increased in early January, which actuates a stable elevation in the prices of mono polysilicon, where the mainstream price of the product has increased to RMB 83-89/kg, with an average price of RMB 86/kg. The overall supply and demand of multi polysilicon is starting to balance in the market, and a small increase in the quotations of low price resources has been observed due to the inflation of mono polysilicon, which prompts the mainstream quotation of multi polysilicon to RMB 52-55/kg, with an average price sitting firmly at RMB 54/kg. With the recent general ascension in the quotations for mono and multi polysilicon, the global polysilicon prices continue to rise, and the average price has been adjusted to US$10.931/W.
An observation on the production and operation plans of various polysilicon businesses indicates that the two businesses among the 11 domestic operation multi polysilicon businesses have resumed operation in early January. The production volume of polysilicon for the Chinese market during 2020 managed to grow to 396K tons despite the impacts from the pandemic in the first half of the year, incidents from businesses, and the periodic overhaul, and the supply of the four polysilicon businesses, including Yongxiang, GCL-Poly, Daqo New Energy, and Xinte Energy, had accounted for over 75% of the figure. As the capacity concentration progressively centralizes on first-tier polysilicon suppliers, businesses are starting to enjoy the advantage in market negotiations under the relatively tight supply of polysilicon in 2021. Looking at the current phase, the wafer sector is beginning to tighten up on stocking with the imminent arrival of the Chinese New Year, and the quotations for polysilicon are likely to escalate further as the supply of the polysilicon market is below the anticipation, and that a number of polysilicon businesses are still attempting to magnify on production capacity.
Wafers 
Wafer quotations have remained stable this week, with a slight reduction in the prices of multi-Si wafers. Mono-Si wafers are maintained in stabilized prices in the market this week owing to the persisting restrained supply and the slow price rises. The downstream production capacity for G1 has been transformed into the production of M6, and the current supply of mono-Si wafers remains tight, with quotations sitting firmly at RMB 3.13/pc and US$0.422/pc. On the other hand, the demand is slightly below the supply for the downstream market during January, and the overall orders of M6 products have comparatively loosened, where partial businesses have commented on the wiggle room for M6 wafers, though the previous sturdy quotations from first-tier businesses have resulted in the domestic and overseas average prices of M6 wafers to linger at RMB 3.23/pc and US$0.435/pc respectively. The prices of large-scale wafers remain stabilized, where the average prices of M10 and G12 wafers are now RMB 3.88/pc and RMB 5.48/pc respectively.
The end demand for multi-Si wafers has yet to recover, and the particular sector is unable to sustain the willingness exhibited from the upstream polysilicon sector in rising quotations, which resulted in the loosened quotations for multi-Si wafers, where the domestic and overseas average prices have been downward adjusted to RMB 1.41/pc and US$0.193/pc.
Cells
Cells have experienced a minor fluctuation this week, which primarily consists of the price reduction of mono-Si M6 cells. In terms of mono-Si cells, despite the stabilized quotations from partial businesses during January, the demand for large-scale products from the end market has slightly weakened after New Year’s Day, where the continuous bargaining between upstream and downstream sectors has enlarged the wiggle room for M6, thus quotations have yet to be stabilized. The high price resources of M6 cells have contracted in the current market, and there are essentially no concluded prices above RMB 0.95/W, where partial orders have fallen below RMB 0.9/W, which induces the domestic average price of mono-Si M6 cells to descend to RMB 0.92/W, with the overseas average price maintained at US$0.124/W.
The overall quotations for G1 cells remain sturdy due to the fewer market supply, whereas the relatively stable supply of large-scale M10 and G12 cells has facilitated resilient quotations, with respective average price at RMB 0.96/W and RMB 0.97/W. The demand for wafers indicates that various cell businesses have yet to decrease production, and module makers will preserve a certain degree of aggressiveness in short-term negotiations.
There have been no apparent fluctuations in the supply and demand for multi-Si cells, and the continuous stabilization in upstream prices has impelled the quotations of cells to remain constant this week, where the domestic price of cells sits firmly at RMB 0.52-0.58/W, and the domestic and overseas average prices are now RMB 0.54/W and US$0.073/W respectively.
Modules
The quotations for modules are predominantly constant this week, with a descending trend seen in the quotations from second and third-tier makers. The overall demand for modules has declined after New Year’s Day, followed by signs of diminishing order volume, and a number of module makers have begun planning for the adjustment on the operating rate. The existing prices for the raw materials of modules are relatively stable, where the negotiations between partial module makers and end projects have propelled the overall market prices to remain constant, which can be seen from the stable average prices of the 325-335W/395-405W and the 355-365/425-435W mono-Si modules at RMB 1.57/W & US$0.212/W and RMB 1.67/W & US$0.226/W respectively. The overall quotations from first-tier module markers are stabilized, with signs of declination in the quotations from second and third-tier makers, and there have been a small amount of successively concluded orders. Large-scale modules continue to stabilize in prices, where the average price of the 182/210 mono-Si PERC module is now at RMB 1.72/W.
The stabilized prices of glass have carried on this week, where the prices of the 3.2mm glass and the 2.00mm glass are sitting at RMB 44-50/㎡ and RMB 32-36/㎡ respectively. Photovoltaic glass prices have slightly fallen back compared to that of last week, and there have been fewer orders of 3.2mm glasses that are concluded at RMB 50/㎡, with the overall concluded price of the market centralized at RMB 44-47/㎡. However, the relatively tight supply of the glass market prompts the anticipation of perpetually stabilized prices of photovoltaic glass within the short term.

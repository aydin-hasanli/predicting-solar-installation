The price of cells, which suffered the sharpest drop in the past, are no longer falling, at least it seems to have stabilized for the past two weeks.

It is expected that this dynamic will drive the market to flourish. Polysilicon The overseas market price of polysilicon is still under the spell of fluctuations of the foreign exchange. The overall price is revised downwards. The domestic market is mainly stable. In the overseas market, the range of the price revision is 8.75~9.74USD/KG at the moment. The average price is lowered to 9.07USD/KG. The global average price is lowered to 8.96USD/KG. In the domestic markets, the price range of polysilicon remains unchanged at 56~62RMB/KG. The price range of the mono polysilicon remains unchanged at 74~78RMB/KG. Wafers The wafer market trend remains stable this week, which coincides with the time where the major manufacturers provide their average contract price at the end of the month. There is no change in the domestic market. However, the overseas market is affected by the exchange rate. The range of the price revision is about 0.01USD/Pc. In the overseas market, the price of the 156.75mm mono-Si wafers is reduced to 0.403USD/Pc at the moment. The price of the 158.75mm mono-Si wafers is reduced to 0.440USD/Pc. The price of the mono-Si wafers with the size of 161.75mm and above is reduced to 0.450USD/Pc. The price range of the multi-Si wafers remains unchanged at 0.231~0.234USD/Pc. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 0.260USD/Pc. In the domestic market, the price range of the mono-Si wafers remains unchanged at 3.07RMB/Pc. Low resistance wafers are 3.12RMB/Pc. The price of the large-size products has increased to 3.45RMB/Pc, which is estimated to be due to the M4- or M6-size products. The range of the multi-Si wafers price revision remains unchanged at 1.80~1.83RMB/Pc. The price of the black silicon products remains unchanged at 2.06RMB/Pc. Cells The market price of the cells continued to maintain stability this week. Although the inventory level of the manufacturers is still high, the market is no longer willing to have the price lowered any further. The price seems to have bottomed out. In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.104~0.123USD/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.105~0.115USD/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.131~0.150USD/W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) remains unchanged at 0.125~0.190USD/W. In the domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.80~0.84RMB/W. The price of the high-efficiency multi-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.85RMB/W. The price range of the general mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.81~0.86RMB/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.93~0.97RMB/W. The price range of the superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) remains unchanged at 0.95~1.02RMB/W. The price of the bifacial high-efficiency mono-Si cells remains unchanged at 0.98RMB/W.The price of the bifacial superior high-efficiency mono-Si cells (>21.5%) remains unchanged at 1.03RMB/W. Modules The module market remains stable, waiting for the market to recover. In the overseas market, the price range of the general multi-Si (270-275W) remains unchanged at 0.205~0.248USD/W at the moment.The price range of high-efficiency multi-Si (280-285W) remains unchanged at 0.216~0.220USD/W. The price range of the general mono-Si (290-295W) remains unchanged at 0.235~0.251USD/W. The price range of the high-efficiency mono-Si (300-305W) remains unchanged at 0.265~0.330USD/W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>310W) remains unchanged at 0.242~0.405USD/W. In the domestic market, the price range of the general multi-Si (270W~275W) remains unchanged at 1.63~1.75RMB/W. The price range of the high-efficiency multi-Si (280W~285W) remains unchanged at 1.78~1.85RMB/W. The price range of the general mono-Si (290W~295W) remains unchanged at 1.83~1.90RMB/W. The price range of high-efficiency mono-Si (300-305W) remains unchanged at 1.90~2.05RMB/W. The price range of the superior-high efficiency mono-Si (>310W) remains unchanged at 1.95~2.13RMB/W.  '"
